# Aleph NixOS Configuration

## Install Nix

- [Determinate Nix installer](https://determinate.systems/nix-installer) (recommended)
- [Upstream Nix installer](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.28/installation/installing-binary#multi-user-installation)

NOTE: The rest of the README assumes you're running Determinate Nix on your local machine. If you are running upstream Nix, you will need to modify the steps accordingly.

Add your username to "trusted-users" in `/etc/nix/nix.custom.conf`:
```
# /etc/nix/nix.custom.conf
trusted-users = root <your_username>
```

Restart the nix-daemon:
```sh
# macos:
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/systems.determinate.nix-daemon
# linux:
sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon.service
```

## System Update

This is the recommended development workflow for iterating on the NixOS configuration. It's significantly faster than the fresh install method (described below) and easier to revert in case of mistakes.

1. Ensure you can SSH into Aleph over WiFi (recommended) or via the USB-C port with the Ethernet gadget enabled (right-most USB-C port).
2. Modify the NixOS configuration in `flake.nix`, `kernel/`, or `modules/`.
3. Run `./deploy.sh`. This copies all necessary store paths to Aleph, activates the new configuration, and creates a new bootloader entry.

To revert to the previous configuration, reboot and select the previous bootloader entry from the boot menu.

NOTE: The bootloader can only be accessed via the serial console. So, you'll need to switch the USB-C cable to the debugger port (left-most USB-C port).

## Fresh Install / Recovery (via USB / SD card)

NOTE: Do not use this method unless you know what you're doing. In most cases, this isn't necessary and you should use the [`System Update`](#system-update) method described above.

This is the recommended way to do a fresh install of NixOS on Aleph. This method is also useful for recovering from a broken system.
This method requires a USB flash drive or SD card with at least 8GB of space. The host system must have Nix installed. In the case of macOS, a remote x86_64-linux (or aarch64-linux) builder is required.

1. Build the sd card image with: `nix build .#sdimage` (run from images/aleph).
2. Flash the sd card image to a flash drive (or SD card if using a nano).
3. Plug the flash drive into the middle USB port on Aleph â€“ you can use a USB hub if you need to power and use the flash drive.
4. Connect to Aleph via serial console and boot from the flash drive. This requires pressing ESC during the boot process, then selecting the flash drive from the boot menu.
5. Log in using `root:root` and run `aleph-installer`.
6. Remove flash drive and reboot Aleph.

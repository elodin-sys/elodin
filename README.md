This monorepo contains the source code for all Elodin simulation and flight software:

- Flight software
  - [`aleph-os`](./images/aleph): Aleph NixOS modules for composing a Linux flight software stack that runs on the Orin.
  - [`elodin-db`](./libs/db) (FSW application): A time-series database which functions as a central telemetry store and message bus.
  - [`serial-bridge`](./fsw/serial-bridge) (FSW application): Reads sensor data being streamed over the serial port and writes it to [`elodin-db`](./libs/db).
  - [`mekf`](./fsw/mekf) (FSW application): A Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter implementation that fuses sensor data to estimate vehicle attitude.
  - [`sensor-fw`](./fsw/sensor-fw): Aleph expansion board firmware that streams sensor data (IMU, mag, baro) to the Orin over USB/UART.
- Simulation software
  - [`nox-py`](./libs/nox-py): Python version of `nox-ecs`, that works with JAX.
- [Editor](./apps/elodin): 3D viewer and graphing tool for visualizing both simulation and flight data.

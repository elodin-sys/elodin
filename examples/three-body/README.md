# Periodic Three-Body Orbit

Recreates a stable three-body choreography using custom gravity edges and Elodin's graph queries. It is a compact demonstration of writing physics directly as systems.

## Run the orbit

```
elodin editor main.py
```

The schematic overlays trails and velocity vectors so you can watch the orbit evolve. Try tweaking the initial positions or masses to explore other solutions from the stable family.

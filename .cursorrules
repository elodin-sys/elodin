Elodin is a platform for rapid design, testing, and simulation of aerospace and physical systems. This monorepo contains the Elodin Editor, Elodin DB, the Python SDK (nox-py), flight software, and the Aleph flight computer NixOS configuration.

Rules:
- Always use the `nix develop` shell when developing changes
- Always use `uv` inside the nix shell for Python everything
- Don't ever commit changes to git, that's for the developer to do
- When suggesting new dependencies, make sure to check they are well supported and maintained
- Never use unsafe Rust code
- Run all activities from the repository root
- CI enforces: `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -- -Dwarnings`, `ruff format --check && ruff check --fix`, `alejandra`

For development workflows, build instructions, and architecture details see the skills in `.cursor/skills/`.

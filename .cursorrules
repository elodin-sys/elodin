Hello! I'm the a software developer of Elodin, which is this repository.

At the most basic high level, "Elodin" is:

1. Elodin Editor & Nox/Nox-Py - A simulator & viewer that can easily and locally do the 10's of thousands of sample rates needed for a real world sensor simulation
2. Elodin DB - A telemetry database that can ingest this huge amount of data in real time or faster
3. Elodin Aleph - A flight computer that uses these things for effective bench top testing

Which enables more rapid software development for physical systems

The recommended development workflow repository wide:

1. Always develop inside a nix develop shell, you can start one in a terminal with:
`nix develop`
Or alternatively can pass it a one-off command:
`nix develop --command "EXAMPLE COMMAND"`

2. For developing nox-py, or running simulations with nox-py changes, you need to build the Elodin SDK Python wheel with:
```
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uvx maturin develop --uv --manifest-path=libs/nox-py/Cargo.toml
```

3. For building both the Elodin Editor and the Elodin DB, use the convenience command:
`just install`

4. For all development, best practice is run all activities from the repository root to prevent confusion and improve multi-tasking. All Readme instructions should assume running from repository root unless there is a reason that is difficult or overly cumbersome.

5. The CI enforces these tests, so make sure they pass if relevant to changes made:
`cargo fmt`
`cargo test`
`cargo clippy -- -Dwarnings`
`ruff format --check && ruff check --fix`
`alejandra`

More information for specific aspects is available by reviewing the many Readme's in the codebase.  Feel free to ask clarifying questions.

Rules:
- always use the nix develop shell when developing changes
- don't ever commit changes to git, that's for me the developer to do
- when suggesting new dependencies, make sure to check they are well supported and maintained
- when debugging Rust code, make sure to use `info!(err, "error message")` similar log messages to make sure it shows up
- eprintln!() and tracing.error!() won't work in this code base, don't use it for debugging

**Advancing High-Fidelity Simulations:**   
**Development of a Real-Time Capable Earth Gravity Model**  
In this presentation, we explore the development of a real-time capable Earth Gravity Model (EGM) that balances computational efficiency and high fidelity. We delve into optimizing the EGM2008 spherical harmonic gravity model, starting from a slower imperative programming style and evolving toward a faster, functional approach. This journey involved rethinking traditional computational methods and manipulating the underlying mathematics to allow the leveraging of JAX’s computational schemes. We will highlight the key mathematical differences between pre-existing implementations and our proposed implementation and how those changes unlocked new speed-ups for us.  
Low-fidelity simulation models can lead to significant problems for spacecraft, such as inaccurate calculations for orbital transfers, rendezvous missions, and re-entry trajectories, potentially causing mission failures or costly delays. These models may result in inefficient control systems, propellant margin errors, and compromised contingency maneuvers during design, while high-fidelity models accrue high computation costs.  
The literature used to develop this model was not intended for vectorized and optimized computations, which led to the initial implementation of the model not being suitable for real-time applications. Additionally, in an attempt to vectorize the mathematics of the literature, some incompatibilities with JAXes architecture were observed, including conditional execution in loops and array mutability and recursive computations. We mitigated many of those issues by pre-computing as much of the conditionals as possible, and vectorizing all other calculations.   
By precomputing many mathematical steps of the EGM2008 model and vectorizing runtime operations inherent to the mathematical structure, we harnessed JAX’s optimized computational frameworks to accelerate computations significantly. As a result, we achieved computation times at full fidelity under 50 milliseconds. For practical applications, models with degrees and orders up to 250 are typically recommended; our implementation achieves run times well under 2.5 milliseconds in these ranges.  
We will demonstrate the power of this optimized EGM through various use cases, such as simulating entire satellite constellations at high fidelity in real time and performing conjunction management efficiently. These capabilities unlock new possibilities for mission planning, real-time simulation applications, and rapid iterative design processes.   
These benchmarks are derived from the Elodin simulation stack, which integrates this gravity model into the Elodin Python API. This approach provides a developer-friendly interface to the computational optimizations of the XLA toolchain. The integration allows developers to seamlessly incorporate high-fidelity gravity modeling into their simulations without the typical computational overhead.

# nox

## Description
`nox` is the **core crate of the Nox engine**, a Rust implementation inspired by [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).  
It provides the **symbolic backend**, **tensor representation**, and **differentiable computation primitives** that power the higher-level Nox crates.

ðŸ“– For a broader introduction to the project, see the [overview documentation](../../docs/public/content/home/tao/jax-nox.md).

## Role of this crate
- Defines the fundamental tensor types (`Scalar`, `Vector`, `Matrix`, `Tensor<_, _, Op>`).  
- Provides the symbolic IR (`Noxpr`) and its integration with XLA for compilation and execution.  
- Implements differentiable programming utilities used across the Nox ecosystem.  
- Serves as the foundation for domain-specific layers (ECS, world management, bindings, etc.).

Most users will **not depend on `nox` directly**. Instead, they will interact with one of the specialized crates or subsystems built on top of it.

## Regenerate Protobufs
First thing first, you will need to make sure you have `protoc` and the [elixir protobuf plugin](https://github.com/elixir-protobuf/protobuf). You can install the plugin with the following command:

```sh 
mix escript.install hex protobuf
```

Next you can regenerate the files by running `just gen` from this folder.

# Testing External Control Solution

## ✅ The Proper Fix

We've implemented a clean solution where `fin_control_trim` is treated as an external control component that the simulation reads but never writes back.

## Test Instructions

### 1. Ensure Everything is Rebuilt

```bash
# Rebuild nox-ecs (contains the fix)
cargo build --release -p nox-ecs

# Rebuild nox-py to pick up the changes
cd libs/nox-py
uvx maturin develop --release --uv

# Rebuild the Rust client
cargo build --release -p elodin-db-rust-client
```

### 2. Start the Rocket Simulation

```bash
cd libs/nox-py
python examples/rocket.py run 0.0.0.0:2240
```

### 3. Run the Control Client

```bash
cd /Users/danieldriscoll/dev/elodin
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/rust_client --host 127.0.0.1 --port 2240
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ In Simulation Terminal
- Component registration messages
- **NO "time travel" warnings**
- **NO "error committing head" errors**
- Smooth operation

### ✅ In Control Client
```
INFO Starting sinusoidal trim control (±2° @ 0.25Hz)
INFO Sent VTable definition for fin control trim
INFO Beginning trim control oscillation...
INFO Trim control oscillating: 0.000° (t=0.0s)
INFO Trim control oscillating: 1.414° (t=2.0s)
```

### ✅ In Elodin Editor
```bash
elodin editor 127.0.0.1:2240
```
- Continuous telemetry display
- Rocket shows oscillating behavior
- No data gaps or freezes

## How It Works

```
Control Client                Database                    Simulation
      |                          |                            |
      |-- Write trim @ T=100 --> |                            |
      |                          | <-- Read trim @ T=100 ---- |
      |                          |                            |
      |                          |     (Integrate physics)    |
      |                          |                            |
      |                          |     (Skip writeback of     |
      |                          |      fin_control_trim)     |
      |                          |                            |
      |-- Write trim @ T=200 --> |                            |
      |                          | <-- Read trim @ T=200 ---- |
```

## Key Points

1. **Simulation reads** the latest trim value from database
2. **Simulation uses** it in physics calculations
3. **Simulation skips** writing it back (marked as external control)
4. **Control client** has exclusive write access
5. **No conflicts** - clean separation of concerns

## Troubleshooting

### If Time Travel Errors Persist

1. **Verify nox-ecs was rebuilt**:
   ```bash
   ls -la target/release/build | grep nox-ecs
   ```

2. **Verify nox-py was rebuilt**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import elodin; print(elodin.__file__)"
   # Should show recent timestamp
   ```

3. **Check the fix is in place**:
   ```bash
   grep -A2 "fin_control_trim" libs/nox-ecs/src/impeller2_server.rs
   ```
   Should show:
   ```rust
   if component_metadata.name == "fin_control_trim" {
       tracing::trace!("Skipping write-back for external control component: {}", pair_name);
       continue;
   ```

### If Control Has No Effect

1. Ensure the simulation is reading the component
2. Check that `aero_coefs` function uses `fin_control_trim`
3. Verify VTable registration in client logs

## Summary

This is the **proper solution** that:
- ✅ Uses normal timestamps
- ✅ No hacky future timestamp workarounds
- ✅ Clean architectural separation
- ✅ Simulation respects external control
- ✅ No timestamp conflicts

The rocket should now respond smoothly to the sinusoidal trim commands with no errors!

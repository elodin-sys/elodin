# Testing the Final Solution

## ✅ Complete Fix Applied

The time travel errors have been resolved using a **future timestamp strategy** that writes control values 10 seconds ahead of the current time.

## Test Procedure

### 1. Start Fresh Simulation
```bash
cd libs/nox-py
python examples/rocket.py run 0.0.0.0:2240
```

### 2. Run the Fixed Rust Client
```bash
cd /Users/danieldriscoll/dev/elodin
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/rust_client --host 127.0.0.1 --port 2240
```

### 3. Verify Success

#### ✅ Expected in Simulation Terminal:
- Component registration messages
- NO "time travel" warnings
- NO "error committing head" errors
- Smooth operation

#### ✅ Expected in Rust Client:
```
INFO Starting sinusoidal trim control (±2° @ 0.25Hz)
INFO Sent VTable definition for fin control trim
INFO Beginning trim control oscillation...
INFO Trim control oscillating: 0.000° (t=0.0s)
INFO Trim control oscillating: 1.414° (t=2.0s)
```

#### ✅ Expected in Elodin Editor:
```bash
elodin editor 127.0.0.1:2240
```
- Telemetry displays correctly
- No freezing or gaps
- Rocket shows oscillating behavior

## How the Fix Works

1. **Control writes future timestamps**: 10 seconds ahead
2. **Simulation reads latest value**: Gets our future control value
3. **Simulation writes current time**: Doesn't overwrite future values
4. **No conflicts**: Both clients coexist peacefully

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No time travel warnings in simulation output
- [ ] Control messages show "future timestamp" in debug logs
- [ ] Rocket fin deflection oscillates as expected
- [ ] Elodin Editor displays continuous data
- [ ] Both terminals show smooth operation

## If Issues Persist

1. **Ensure latest build**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release -p elodin-db-rust-client
   ```

2. **Check both processes are running**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "rocket.py|rust_client"
   ```

3. **Verify port 2240 is in use**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i:2240
   ```

## Summary

The bidirectional control system is now fully operational with:
- ✅ Telemetry streaming FROM simulation
- ✅ Control commands TO simulation
- ✅ No timestamp conflicts
- ✅ Real-time oscillating trim control
- ✅ Compatible with Elodin Editor

The future timestamp workaround ensures reliable operation without modifying the core simulation or database infrastructure.

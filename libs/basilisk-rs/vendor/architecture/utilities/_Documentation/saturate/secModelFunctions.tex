\section{Model Functions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Set Bounds}: Takes in a matrix of state max and mins.
	\item \textbf{Saturate}:  Saturates the input vector according to the max and mins.
\end{itemize}


\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
This code makes no real assumptions. It is up to the user not to give max values that are less than min values and any other inputs that could cause trouble.

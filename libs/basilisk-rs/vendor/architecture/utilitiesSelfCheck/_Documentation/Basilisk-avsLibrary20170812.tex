% README file for moduleDocumentationTemplate TeX template.
% This template should be used to document all Basilisk modules.
% Updated 20170711 - S. Carnahan
%
%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder
%
%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately
%
% All edits should be made in one of:
% sec_modelAssumptionsLimitations.tex
% sec_modelDescription.tex
% sec_modelFunctions.tex
% sec_revisionTable.tex
% sec_testDescription.tex
% sec_testParameters.tex
% sec_testResults.tex
% sec_user_guide.tex
%
%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the suer guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

\newcommand{\summary}{The AVS Library has released a series of C, Matlab and Mathematica support routines to perform common astrodynamics functions.  This document outlines how these support files are automatically validated within the Basilisk environment.  There are C-based functions that run each routine with sample input, and compare to hand computed answers if the function response is correct.  This checking is performed automatically every time {\tt pytest} is run on the root Basilisk folder. }

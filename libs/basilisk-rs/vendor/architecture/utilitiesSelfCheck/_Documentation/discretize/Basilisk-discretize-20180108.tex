%README file for moduleDocumentationTemplate TeX template.
%This template should be used to document all Basilisk modules.
%Updated 20170711 - S. Carnahan
%
%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder
%
%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately
%
%-All edits should be made in one of:
%—header.tex
%— modelAssumptionsLimitations.tex
%— modelDescription.tex
%— modelFunctions.tex
%— revisionTable.tex
%— testDescription.tex
%— testParameters.tex
%— testResults.tex
%— user_guide.tex
%
%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the suer guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

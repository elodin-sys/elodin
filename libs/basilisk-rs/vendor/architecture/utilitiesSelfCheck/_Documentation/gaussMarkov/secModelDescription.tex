\section{Model Description}

This utility produces white noise. It can have a bias added to it to make a non-zero mean. It also generates "random walk" by treating the noise as additive. Walk bounds can be provided that push the random walk away from the boundary. This is not a saturate or rail, but rather an exponential correction.

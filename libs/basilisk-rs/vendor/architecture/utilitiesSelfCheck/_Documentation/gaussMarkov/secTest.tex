\subsection{Test Descriptions}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item \underline{Standard Deviation} The module is called 1 hundred thousand times and  the standard deviation is found to be within 1 percent of the input.
	\subitem \textbf{Mean}: The utility is run one hundred thousand times and the mean is found to be within 0.5\% of the standard deviation from zero for each state.
	\item \underline{Bounds} The utility is run one million times and the max/min outputs are tested against a known value which is close to, but not exactly the walk bounds.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Module Functions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Process Array of time tagged accelerometer data}: The acceleration data in the message comes in the form of an unsorted time-tagged list
	\item \textbf{Only process data since the reset() function}: Ensure that any old data in the message that was measured prior to the Reset() function call is not processed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}
The module assumes all accelerometer vector measurements have their components taken with respect to the body frame $\cal B$.

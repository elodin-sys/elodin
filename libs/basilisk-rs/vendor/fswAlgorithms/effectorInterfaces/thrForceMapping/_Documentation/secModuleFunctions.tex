\section{Module Functions}
This module has the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Evaluate RW null projection matrix $[\tau]$}: When reset the module will pull in the current RW configuration data and create the null motion projection matrix.  This matrix remains fixed unit the module is reset again.
	\item \textbf{Compute a RW deceleration torque}: With each update call the module computes a decelerating RW torque solution that lies in the null space of the RW array.
	\item \textbf{Output a net RW motor torque solution}:  The module combined the feedback control torque and the null space torque to slow down the RW speeds and outputs a net solution solution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}
The module assumes all RW devices are operating and available.  It also assumes the RW spin axes don't change during the regular update cycles.

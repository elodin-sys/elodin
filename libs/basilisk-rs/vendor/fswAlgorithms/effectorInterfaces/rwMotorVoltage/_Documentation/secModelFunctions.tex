\section{Model Functions}
The code performs the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Reset}: Resets the rwMotorVoltage module to original settings.
	\item \textbf{Closed loop}: Evaluates commanded torque based on closed loop controls.
	\item \textbf{Torque to Voltage}: Uses gains to convert a given torque to a voltage output.
	\item \textbf{Saturation}:  Checks that calculated output is within min/max bounds.
\end{itemize}


\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
This code makes the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Linear}: This code assumes that there is a linear relationship between the torque desired and the voltage required to create that torque.
\end{itemize}

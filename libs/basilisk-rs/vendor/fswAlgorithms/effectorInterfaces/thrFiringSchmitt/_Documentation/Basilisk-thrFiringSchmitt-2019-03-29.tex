% README file for moduleDocumentationTemplate TeX template.
% This template should be used to document all Basilisk modules.
% Updated 20170711 - S. Carnahan
%
%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder
%
%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately
%
% All edits should be made in one of:
% sec_modelAssumptionsLimitations.tex
% sec_modelDescription.tex
% sec_modelFunctions.tex
% sec_revisionTable.tex
% sec_testDescription.tex
% sec_testParameters.tex
% sec_testResults.tex
% sec_user_guide.tex
%
% NOTE: if the TeX document is reading in auto-generated TeX snippets from the AutoTeX folder, then
%            pytest must first be run for the unit test of this module.  This process creates the required unit test results 
%.           that are read into this document.  
%
%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the user guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

\newcommand{\summary}{A Schmitt trigger logic is implemented to map a desired thruster force value into a thruster on command time. The module reads in the attitude control thruster force values for both on- and off-pulsing scenarios, and then maps this into a time which specifies how long a thruster should be on.  The thruster configuration data is read in through a separate input message in the reset method.  The Schmitt trigger allows for an upper and lower bound where the thruster is either turned on or off.}

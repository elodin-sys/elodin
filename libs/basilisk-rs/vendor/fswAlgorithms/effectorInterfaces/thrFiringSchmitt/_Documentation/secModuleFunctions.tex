\section{Module Functions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Read in thruster configuration message}: This is used to determine the number of installed thrusters and what the maximum force is for each.
	\item \textbf{Convert thruster force requested into an on-time request}: Knowing how strong the thruster is, the on-time is scaled such that the effectively applied force is equal to the requested force.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}
The module assumes that the incoming forces $F_{i}$ can be both positive or negative, depending if an on- or off-pulsing mode is being implemented.  The particular mode is set through {\tt baseThrustState}.

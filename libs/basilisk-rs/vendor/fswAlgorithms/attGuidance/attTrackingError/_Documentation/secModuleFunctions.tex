\section{Module Functions}

The only specific function to this module is the error computation function. It's only goal is to remove the computation from the update function itself.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{computeAttitudeError}: This function calculates computes the attitude error between the reference and the spacecraft attitude.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}

No assumptions or limitations are made specifically in this module. It simply uses the input messages to output an error between two different attitudes and rates.

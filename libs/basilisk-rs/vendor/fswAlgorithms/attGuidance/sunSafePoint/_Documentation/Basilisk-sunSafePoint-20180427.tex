%-Copy the contents of this folder to your own _Documentation folder

%-Rename the Basilisk-moduleDocumentationTemplate.tex appropriately

% All edits should be made in one of:

%-Some rules about referencing within the document:
%1. If writing the suer guide, assume the module description is present
%2. If writing the validation section, assume the module features section is present
%3. Make no other assumptions about any sections being present. This allow for sections of the document to be used elsewhere without breaking.

%In order to import some of these sections into a document in a different directory:
%\usepackage{import}
%Then, the sections are called with \subimport{relative path}{file} in order to \input{file} using the right relative path.
%\import{full path}{file} can also be used if absolute paths are preferred over relative paths.

\newcommand{\summary}{This module provides the attitude guidance output for a sun pointing mode.  This could be used for safe mode, or a power generation mode.  The input is the sun direction vector which doesn't have to be normalized, as well as the body rate information.  The output is the standard BSK attitude reference state message.  The sun direction measurement is cross with the desired body axis that is to point at the sun to create a principle rotation vector.  The dot product between these two vectors is used to extract the principal rotation angle.  With these a tracking error MRP state is computer.  The body rate tracking errors relative to the reference frame are set equal to the measured body rates to bring the vehicle to rest when pointing at the sun.  Thus, the reference angular rate and acceleration vectors relative to the inertial frame are nominally set to zero.  If the sun vector is not available, then the reference rate is set to a body-fixed value while the attitude tracking error is set to zero.  }

\section{Module Functions}
The FSW module purpose is to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Set a desired inertial orientation}: The referernce frame orientation is specified through an MRP set.
	\item \textbf{Zero the rate information}: The reference frame angular rates and accelerations are zeroed as this reference frame is inertially fixed. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}
This simple module has no assumptions or limitations.

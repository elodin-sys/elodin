\section{Module Functions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Read in $\Delta v$ information}: The nominal $\Delta v$ maneuver information is read in to establish a base burn reference frame
	\item \textbf{Allow for a constant rotation}: The reference frame is rotated at a constant rate during the burn duration.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Assumptions and Limitations}
The module assumes the rotation rate is constant.  Further, the burn direction is assumed to be along the first reference frame axis.

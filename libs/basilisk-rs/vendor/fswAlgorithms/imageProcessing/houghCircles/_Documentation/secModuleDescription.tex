\section{Model Description}

This module imports OpenCV which is installed if the cmake option is triggered. Two cases are possible: a filename for an image can be given, or an image message containing a size and pointer to image data can be used. If the message is read, the size is used to decode the image into an OpenCV matrix for image processing.

The following methods are then applied to the image:
\begin{itemize}
\item Greyscale
\item Blurr
\item Thresholding
\item HoughCircles (which contains a Canny edge detection transform)
\end{itemize}

This allows for circles to be detected. The default parameters are set to be efficient at planet finding, as the text examples show.

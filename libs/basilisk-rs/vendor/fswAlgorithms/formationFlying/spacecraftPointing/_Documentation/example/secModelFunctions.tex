\section{Model Functions}
This section will contain a bullet-list and descriptions of what functions this module performs. For example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{computeField()}: The gravity effector module computes the gravity field from a celestial body including spherical harmonics.
	\item \textbf{computeField()}: The gravity effector module computes the gravity field from a celestial body including spherical harmonics.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Assumptions and Limitations}
This section should describe the assumptions used in formulating the mathematical model and how those assumptions limit the usefulness of the module.

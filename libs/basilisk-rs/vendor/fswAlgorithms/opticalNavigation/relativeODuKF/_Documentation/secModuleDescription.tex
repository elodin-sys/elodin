\section{Model Description}

This module implements a square-root unscented Kalman Filter in order to achieve it's best state estimate of the inertial spacecraft attitude states. The estimated state is the attitude (MRPs) and the spacecraft rotation rate in the body frame. 

\textbf{Important:} The default units in Basilisk are meters for distance, and meters per second for speed. These are the units to be used for this filter, though the internals use km and km/s for numerical precision. 

\subsection{Filter Setup} %%%

The equations and algorithm for the square root uKF are given in "inertialUKF$\_$DesignBasis.pdf" [\citenum{Wan2001}] alongside this document.
The filter is therefore derived with the states being $\bm X =\begin{bmatrix} \leftexp{N}{\bm r}&  \leftexp{N}{\bm v} \end{bmatrix}^{T}$

The dynamics of the filter are given in Equations \eqref{eq:dynInertial}. $\tau$ is the total torque read in by the wheels. 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:dynInertial}
\dot{\bm r} &=\bm v \\
\dot{\bm v} & = - \frac{\mu}{|\bm r|^3} \bm r
\end{align}

The propagation is done using an RK4 integrator. 
The following square-root uKF coefficients are used: $\alpha = 0.02$, and $\beta = 2$. 


\subsection{Measurements}

The measurement model is simple given the pre-processing by the pixelLineConverter, which extracts the pixel Line transformations from the filter code. This is done to simplify the upkeep and modularity of the filter for Optical Navigation. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:meas}
\bm G_i(\bm X) = \bm r
\end{equation}

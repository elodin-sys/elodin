Stay tuned for our next features!

<Steps>
  <Step title="ECS Physics Toolkit" icon="cubes">
    The next big step for Elodin is our customizable Physics toolkit.
    Soon, you will be able to create custom physics engines in our sandbox rather than
    just the Featherstone-based engine currently available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monte Carlo Alpha" icon="dice">
    Next, we will launch a public alpha of our Monte Carlo simulation runner.
    It will allow you to easily run massive numbers of simulations in parallel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improved 3D Editor" icon="pencil">
    As if that wasn't enough, we will add more features to our 3D viewer to make it a fully interactive editor.

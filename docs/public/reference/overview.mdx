## Simulation Architecture

An Elodin simulation consists of:
- **Systems**: Systems are reusable functions that operate on a set of components. Composing different systems allows for the creation of custom physics engines. Some examples of systems include gravity, aerodynamics, collision detection.
- **World**: World is a container of all the entities in the simulation. See [ECS Data Model](#ecs-data-model) for more context on entities.
- **Flight Software (FSW)**: Flight software is a set of processes that run independent of the simulation. Using conduit, FSW subscribes to relevant simulation data and sends control commands back to the simulation.

## ECS Data Model

Elodin uses the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern to manage simulation data. Entities are simply unique references to a collection of components. Components are individual properties associated with an entity like position, velocity, mass, etc.

Archetypes are a unique combination of components that allow for efficient memory management and data access patterns. Entities are spawned with a list of archetypes rather than individual components.

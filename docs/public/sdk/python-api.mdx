## Primitives

### _class_ `elodin.Quaternion`

Unit quaternions are used to represent spatial orientations and rotations of bodies in 3D space.

- `Quaternion.identity()` -> [elodin.Quaternion]

    Create a unit quaternion with no rotation.

- `Quaternion.from_axis_angle()` -> [elodin.Quaternion]

    Create a quaternion from an axis and an angle. 

- `inverse()` -> [elodin.Quaternion]

    Compute the inverse of the quaternion.

- `normalize()` -> [elodin.Quaternion]

    Normalize to a unit quaternion.


## Spatial Vector Algebra

Elodin uses Featherstoneâ€™s spatial vector algebra notation for rigid-body dynamics as it is a compact way of representing the state of a rigid body with six degrees of freedom. You can read a short into [here](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/courses/amath533/FeatherstoneSlides.pdf) or in [Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms (Featherstone - 2008)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7560-7).

### _class_ `elodin.SpatialTransform`

A spatial transform is a 7D vector that represents a rigid body transformation in 3D space.

- `SpatialTransform.from_linear(linear)` -> [elodin.SpatialTransform]

    Create a spatial transform from a linear vector.

- `SpatialTransform.from_angular(quaternion)` -> [elodin.SpatialTransform]

    Create a spatial transform from a quaternion.

- `linear()` -> [jax.Array]

    Get the linear part of the spatial transform as a vector with shape (3,).

- `angular()` -> [elodin.Quaternion]

    Get the angular part of the spatial transform as a quaternion.

### _class_ `elodin.SpatialMotion`

A spatial motion is a 6D vector that represents the velocity of a rigid body in 3D space.

- `SpatialMotion.from_linear(linear)` -> [elodin.SpatialMotion]

    Create a spatial motion from a linear vector.

- `SpatialMotion.from_angular(angular)` -> [elodin.SpatialMotion]

    Create a spatial motion from an angular vector.

- `linear()` -> [jax.Array]

    Get the linear part of the spatial motion as a vector with shape (3,).

- `angular()` -> [jax.Array]

    Get the angular part of the spatial motion as a vector with shape (3,).

### _class_ `elodin.SpatialForce`

A spatial force is a 6D vector that represents the linear force and torque applied to a rigid body in 3D space.

- `SpatialForce.from_linear(linear)` -> [elodin.SpatialForce]

    Create a spatial force from a linear force vector.

- `SpatialForce.from_torque(angular)` -> [elodin.SpatialForce]

    Create a spatial force from a torque vector.

- `force()` -> [jax.Array]

    Get the linear force part of the spatial force as a vector with shape (3,).

- `torque()` -> [jax.Array]

    Get the torque part of the spatial force as a vector with shape (3,).

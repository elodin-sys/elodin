Elodin DB is a time-series database purpose built for flight computers. It is designed as a central telemetry store and message bus. Flight software publish and subscribes to telemetry data and messages from Elodin DB.

Elodin DB is based on the same ECS system as Elodin Sim (and the rest of the Elodin ecosystem). Elodin DB sorts data into "entities" and "components". Entities are best thought as objects that emit telemetry. For instance an individual sensor would be an entity. A component is a piece of telemetry data that is associated with an entity. For example an accelerator's acceleration reading would be a component. Entities can have multiple components, and each component can be associated with multiple entities.

Elodin DB chiefly communicates over `impeller` -- Elodin's lightweight message protocol designed for flight software. In addition to `impeller`, Elodin DB can be queries via SQL and results are returned in the Arrow IPC format.

## Quick Start

Install Elodin DB from the [releases](https://github.com/elodin-sys/elodin/releases) page.


To start a new instance of Elodin DB, use the following command:
```sh
elodin-db run
```

### Lua REPL

The easiest way to interact with Elodin DB is through its Lua REPL. To start the REPL, run the following command:

```sh
elodin-db lua
```

You can connect to the database by running:

```lua
client = connect("localhost:2240")
```


### SQL

You can query Elodin DB via SQL. The easiest way to access this interface is through the REPL where you can run the following command to connect to the database using SQL

```lua
:sql [::]:2240
```

This will connect to your local instance of Elodin DB, and drop you into a SQL REPL.

To list the available tables, run:

```sql
show tables;
```

We use Datafusion to power the SQL interface. [Their docs](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/index.html) are the best place for details on the dialect.

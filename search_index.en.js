three-body problem is a classic orbital dynamics situation.\nYou have three bodies, each with significant mass, all interacting gravitationally.\nThis turns out to be a chaotic system, with no general closed-form solution. There are however\na few stable configurations of the three-body problem.\nIn this tutorial, we will model one of the stable configurations from\nR. A. Broucke's technical report \"Period Orbits in the Restricted Three-Body Problem with Earth Moon Masses\".\nImport Elodin and JAX\nOur first step is to import Elodin and Jax into our environment:\n\nSIM_TIME_STEP value is the duration of each tick in the simulation.\nAdd 1st &amp; 2nd Body\nBefore we can do anything we'll need an instance of a World, and with that we can spawn our first entities:\n\nAdd a basic system\nLet's bring in the simplified earth gravity system we just used in the ball example:\n\nLet's try running the simulation\nBut first, let's add a view port so we can observe the world:\n\nNow, we're ready to start simulating:\n\nAt this point you should have a running simulation, with two bodies that simply fall just like the ball example.\nHowever we don't want a simulation of basic earth gravity, but instead we want the bodies to interact which\neach other gravitationally like planetary bodies, so let's update our system for that next.\nSetup Gravity Constraints\nThe gravitational force between two bodies is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n$$\nF_{ba}=-G\\frac{m_bm_a}{|r_{ba}|^3}{r}_{ba}\n$$\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Notice how we're using the Vector form of Newton's law,\ninstead of the more well known scalar form. This is\nbecause we're working in a 3D space. Sometimes you may have to convert between the two forms yourself.\n\n    \n\n\nLet's model this as a system that iterates over all gravity edges in a graph of connected bodies and calculates the forces between them.\nModeling with graphs and edges is a more advanced Elodin API, review the documentation for it here.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nAlso let's update the initial mass of our two bodies with the gravitational constant, this\nwill give them a mass more representative of a planetary body:\n\nGo ahead and run the simulation again, and you should see the two bodies interacting gravitationally.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        You'll want to make sure to always keep the six_dof() and w.run() calls at the end of your script.\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nAdd the Third Body\nWhat's a gravitational system without a third body? Let's add a third body to the system.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nIf you run the simulation now, you'll see the three bodies interacting gravitationally. However, you'll notice that the it's a bit unstable.\nA stable starting configuration\nThere are many known stable configurations for three-body systems, one of the most famous being the Lagrange points.\nFor our first attempt we'll reference the Brouke R 7 configuration, which is a stable configuration for three bodies of equal mass.\nGo ahead and update the starting values for our three bodies to the following:\n\nStart the simulation again, and you should see the three bodies in a stable configuration.\nAdd some gizmos\nSometimes it can be helpful to visualize the forces acting on the bodies and their movements in 3D space. Add these two\nlines to see a few options in action:\n\nStart the simulation again to see the gizmos in action.\nChecking your work\nAnd that's it!

Align the board-to-board connector and gently press the boards together. The boards should be flush with each other.\nUse the provided screws to secure the boards together via the pre-mounted standoffs.\nPowering On\nBoth the carrier and expansion boards come with software pre-installed.\nDuring normal development, you'll use 2 USB-C cables: one to power the board, and the other to connect to your laptop:\n\nConnect \"USB-C Power\" to a 30W+ USB-PD power supply.\nEither:\n\nConnect \"USB-C w/ Serial\" to your laptop for serial console access.\nOR Connect \"USB-C w/ Ethernet\" to your laptop for an ethernet connection to the carrier board, allowing SSH access\n\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and connect your USB-C cables now. Aleph will power on automatically when connected to power. If the fan doesn't spin, it may be in manual mode.\nThere is a switch on the underside of the carrier board to toggle between manual and automatic power-on.

This will demonstrate how to:\n\nSet up a basic physics simulation\nAdd multiple interacting systems\nBreak code into multiple files for better organization\n\nBasic Ball Simulation Setup\nAs a starting point, let's first setup a world with just a ball and gravity.\nImport Elodin and JAX\nFirst, let's import our required libraries:\n\nNotice we're importing typing and dataclasses, we'll use these later.\nCreate the World\nNow let's set up our simulation world:\n\nWe create a new elodin world, spawn an entity named \"Ball\" with a sphere mesh shape component, and a body archetype\nwhich provides the ball with a position, velocity, and other aspects related to the Elodin 6DoF system\n(see the 6DoF reference for more info).\nWe also spawn a viewport and a line to visualize the ball's position.\nDefine gravity\nLet's bring in our system for basic gravity:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Let's take a moment to understand the use of @el.map. This decorator creates an Elodin system from a function.\nThe inputs of the function acts a filter for which entities this applies to.  In this case, when the system is\nintegrated, the entities that have a Force and Inertia component will have this function applied to them. The function returns the\nupdated force, which is then used to update the velocity and position of the ball during integration in the system function below.\n\n    \n\nDefine the System\nLet's combine our systems into one complete simulation:\n\nRunning the Simulation\nWith everything set up, we can now run the simulation:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        The max_ticks parameter is used to limit the number of simulation steps. This is useful for debugging and testing. Notice how in this\ncase the simulation only runs for 10 seconds (1200 ticks at 120 ticks per second).\n\n    \n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nBouncing off the Ground\nYou'll notice that the ball falls beautifully, and right through the \"ground\" into infinity. Let's introduce\na system to handle bouncing off the ground instead:\n\nThe JAX syntax can be visually daunting at first; let's break this down:\nThe JAX lax.cond function is used to conditionally apply the bounce, if the position of the ball is below the ground.\nThe first argument is the condition, the second is the function to apply if the condition is true, and the third\nis the function to apply if the condition is false. The operand argument is not used in this case, so it's set to None.\nOur bounce is applied by reversing the velocity in the z-direction. We'll add \"bounciness\" later.\nUpdate the System\nWe now have two systems, gravity and bounce, that we want to apply to our simulation. We can combine them into a single system\nwith the concept of pipelining systems. Let's update our system function:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Notice we use a pipe | to combine the systems. This is a powerful concept in Elodin that allows you to chain systems together.\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        But why is gravity supplied to six_dof, while bounce is not? You'll notice bounce returns the resulting velocity, while gravity only\nsupplies forces that still need to be applied by an integrator. The six_dof system is an integrator that applies forces to update the\nvelocity and position of the ball. See the six_dof reference documentation\nfor more information.\n\n    \n\nWith bounce applied, let's try running it again:\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nLet's Make it Windy\nHaving a fully customizable ball bouncing physics simulation is great, but let's make it more interesting by adding some\nrandomized wind forces into the mix. We'll need to make a few changes to our simulation to accommodate this:\nCreate the Wind Component\nWe'll need a component to represent the wind force in our simulation:\n\nAdd Global Wind Data\nWe'll use a custom Archetype called \"WindData\" to maintain our random number generator seed and wind state:\n\nAlso make sure to update your world function to add a WindData instance:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        This is a simple technique to add global data into your simulation for easy reference.\n\n\n\n    \n\nWe'll need to set a value for the wind force in our WindData instance. We can do this by creating a system that generates\na random wind force vector and sets it in the Wind component of our WindData instance.\n\nThis system queries for Archetypes with Seed and Wind components, which will only be our\nsingle \"WindData\" Archetype entity, and then uses the value of the seed with the random key\nfunction to generate a random wind force vector to set for the Wind component.\nAdd the Wind Physics System\nNow we need a system to apply our wind force to objects. We could just naiively apply the force of the wind\nto our ball, but this wouldn't create a physically realistic simulation. Instead we can borrow from\nfluid dynamics and leverage the Simple Drag Equation:\n$$\nF_{d}=c_{d}r\\frac{v^2}{2}A\n$$\nThe drag equation states that drag force Fd is equal to the drag coefficient Cd times the density r\ntimes half of the velocity V squared times the reference area A\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Let's take a moment to understand @el.system, a lower level API for composing raw systems in Elodin:\n\nWhen this system is run, it will query for entities with the Wind component and entities with both Force and WorldVel components. These\nare provided as arrays of matching entities to the function body as w and q respectively. The function body is then expected to return a\nnew Query of Force component attached entities, which in this case the Query.map function provides. See\nQuery.map for more details.\n\n    \n\nUpdate the System Function\nFinally, we need to update our system function to include the wind and drag systems:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Notice we've made a distinction now of \"effectors\" as systems which return forces that will be integrated in the 6DoF model.\n\n    \n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nImproving the Wind Model\nYou'll notice that we're currently only considering the velocity of the fluid (wind) in the direction of the wind vector.\nThis is a simplification of the actual drag force due to wind that would be applied to the ball, because the ball's movement\nthrough the air also creates a movement of air fluid experienced by the ball.\n\n    \n    \n\nLet's update our apply_drag system to consider this additional aspect of air fluid movement:\n\nAnd voila! We now have a more accurate wind model that accounts for the drag force\non the ball as it moves through the air, notice how the ball now loses energy as it struggles against\nthe drag force along it's direction of movement.\nSpeaking of losing energy, there is one more thing we can do to improve the simulation: Add a coefficient of restitution\nto represent the \"bounciness\" of the ball. This will allow us to model the ball losing energy on each bounce.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nThis bounce system uses a coefficient of restitution of 0.85,\nmeaning the ball will lose 15% of its energy on each bounce.\nMake it Windy, Simpler\nCrafting a simulation in Elodin allows for approaching a problem in multiple ways. We can simplify our wind simulation\nby considering the wind not as a global constant, but instead as a force that affects the ball directly, as experienced from the perspective\nof the ball entity. This will allow us to use the same apply_drag system, but using the @el.map decorator instead of @el.system,\nallowing for a simpler implementation.\nUpdate the Ball Entity\nFirst remove the global spawn of WindData and instead add a WindData component to the ball entity:\n\nConvert use of @el.System\nYou can now convert the sample_wind system to use the simpler @el.map decorator:\n\nAnd likewise the apply_drag system can be simplified to directly query the wind component from the ball entity,\nresulting in much simpler syntax and conceptual model:\n\nYou should be able to run the simulation and see the same behavior as before, but with a simpler implementation.\nChecking your work\nSuccess! We've added a wind force to our simulation. The ball now bounces around the world with the wind\naffecting its trajectory, steadily blowing the ball in a single direction, losing energy as it bounces.\nIf you'd like to check your work, you can compare to the example at examples/ball/.\n\n","id":"/home/bouncing-ball/","title":"Bouncing Ball"},"/home/db/architecture/":{"body":"Elodin DB is built around the same entity-component concepts that Elodin Sim and Impeller use. In essence entities represent logical \"objects\" in the system -- think sensors, actuators, spacecraft. Components represent individual pieces of telemetry - think a sensor reading, an attitude estimate, an actuator commanded position, etc.\nData Model\nThe core primitive of Elodin DB is the tensor, or the n-dimensional array. A scalar is a 0 dimensional tensor, a vector is a 1 dimensional tensor, a matrix is a 2 dimensional tensor, and so on. Tensors in Elodin DB have a dimension, a primitive type (f64, f32, etc), and their associated data. Tensors are fixed size and dense (non-sparse).\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        We are using tensor in the ML framework / programming sense, not the pure mathematical sense.\n\n    \n\nElodin DB stores tensors in time-series columns associated with a particular entity-component pair. Conceptually each entity-component pair is a table with each row being a timestamp, and a tensor. Timestamps are stored as i64 microsecond offsets from Unix epoch.\nTimeData\n1742223919e6[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n1742223919[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]\n\nVTable\nElodin DB uses a dynamic data-extraction system for fast data-ingest. Instead of requiring that data is sent in a fixed format - Elodin DB allows users to generate a vtable that describes the data being ingested. Loosely this can be thought of as a collection of offsets combined with entity and component ids. We borrowed the concept of a vtable from FlatBuffers, which use them in a similar manner.\nOne of the powers of VTables is that it lets us send raw structs over the wire, without serializing them. For instance take this struct:\n\nThis struct contains a number of fields each associated with a different component. We can send Elodin DB this struct, unchanged, by formulating a VTable like below.\n\nIn this example we are using a Lua script with the VTableBuilder API. Each time we call column it increments the internal offset by the size of the tensor. So the final VTable looks like this\nOffsetComponent IDTypeShapeEntity IDs\n0tsu32[][1]\n4magf32[3][1]\n16gyrof32[3][1]\n28accelf32[3][1]\n40mag_tempf32[][1]\n44mag_sampleu32[][1]\n48barof32[][1]\n52baro_tempf32[][1]\n\nMessages\nUp until now we've discussed how to store telemetry that best fits into a time series of fixed-size tensors. Sometimes our data doesn't fit cleanly into the concept of \"telemetry\" and fixed sized structures. What if we want to send a single message that contains a variable length sequence of commands? What if we want to send compressed data that is variable length? What if we want to signal a state transition using an enum?\nFor these cases, Elodin DB supports messages which are variable length, postcard encoded. This allows you to pack virtually any data structure that postcard can represent.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Technically, you can store any variable length data in a message, but for all of Elodin DB's features to work postcard is the best choice.\n\n    \n\nMessages are stored in a table made up of three-columns: a timestamp, an \"offset\" column, and a \"data\" column. The offset column is encoded using the Umbra string format (also called German Strings). Instead of just storing a length and offset to the data - an Umbra string optionally stores the data inline with the length. This allows for fast path lookups up data less than 12 bytes. Our implementation of this table is designed to be compatible with the Arrow \"Variable-size Binary View Layout\".\nOn Disk Layout\nElodin DB uses a collection of memory mapped files to store data. Each separate column in a table maps to a different memory mapped file in its own directory. The files are not meant to be human readable. The directory structure is documented here for information purposes only.\n\n","id":"/home/db/architecture/","title":"Architecture"},"/home/db/overview/":{"body":"Elodin DB is a time-series database purpose built for flight computers.

Flight software publish and subscribes to telemetry data and messages from Elodin DB.\nElodin DB is based on the same ECS system as Elodin Sim (and the rest of the Elodin ecosystem). Elodin DB sorts data into \"entities\" and \"components\". Entities are best thought as objects that emit telemetry. For instance an individual sensor would be an entity. A component is a piece of telemetry data that is associated with an entity. For example an accelerator's acceleration reading would be a component.

You can send data as a tuple of the entity id, component id, and value, like so:\n\nThis might not seem impressive at first blush, but it offers some really nice benefits. Say the control software wants to update the simulated motor rpm; all it would have to do is send the following msg to the simulation software.\n\nThe simulation software can also send out sensor output this same way.\n\nThis is nice because it means reacting to new inputs and producing outputs that work with the same systems that we use for the core simulation above.\nWe use Impel to record the entire state of the system. We create a recorder service that subscribes to all components and entities from the simulation and control software. Every time it receives a message, it adds it to a table. Then, you can use that data to query the entire state of the system at any time.

It is most used in the context of video games, but as we will find out, it has been used in other places. I'm going to tell a slightly falsified version of the history of ECS to motivate its existence. The first thing to understand is how video games, simulations, and many other software pieces were historically developed using a vaguely object-oriented model. The player would be a class like:\n\nEnemies would be another class in a similar vein. Maybe you would share some attributes between similar types of objects using inheritance, like:\n\nThis way of modeling virtual worlds can feel natural since it matches how we often think about the world. But it has some serious downsides. One key problem is that the world does not have a strict hierarchy. Oftentimes, two things may share a similar behavior but are unrelated in the traditional sense. The other issue is performance. The game object style stores all of an object's data together in a single class, often in the heap. At first, this sounds like an advantage since you can load a single object's data together at the same time. But it has some serious downsides. What if I want to integrate the velocity of all the GameObjects and add it to the position? I will have to write a for loop over all the GameObjects in the world and run the integrate function each time. Each time that function runs, the CPU loads the required fields from RAM and into the CPU cache. But, the CPU doesn't just load the needed fields; it loads all the memory around the GameObject into the cache. This process is called cache prefetching. Ideally, all the GameObjects would be loaded into the cache at once since accessing RAM is slow. But it's time-consuming for the CPU to do that since they are all spread around the heap and are usually large. The next issue is that it is difficult for systems like this to utilize vector instructions effectively. Vector instructions allow you to run the same computation many times in parallel.\nECS has taken the game development world by storm because it solves both problems simply and elegantly. ECS is best visualized as a table\nEntity IDPosVelHealthInventory\n10,0,010,0,01.0\n21,1,20,0,00.0[Apple, Pear]\n\nIn ECS, you have entities, components, and systems. Entities are collections of components and an ID. Components are individual properties associated with an entity, like position, velocity, or health. In an ECS system, the integrated example from above would look like this:\n\nThe code above describes a system, basically a function that operates on a set of components. When this function is run, the computer prefetches all the positions and all the velocities at once. This means that while integrate is running, you never have any cache-missing. It also means that you can effectively utilize vector instructions to speed up the computation. Below is a hypothetical implementation of integrate, where you interact with the entire array at once.\n\nThe clean version of the ECS story is that it has become a more appealing technology as CPU and GPU speed has rapidly outpaced the speed of memory. High-performance applications are usually dominated not by the actual computation time but by memory waits.\nThe true history is that ECS has likely been developed numerous times independently. Some sources (i.e., Wikipedia) cite the 1998 game Thief: The Dark Project as the first time it was used, but they were largely popularized roughly ten years later in a series of blog posts by Adam Martin. Recently, they are starting to gain traction outside of game development.\nAn ECS-based Configurable Physics Engine\nECS isn't just great for video games; it is widely applicable to all kinds of applications. In particular, simulations are a perfect fit for ECS. Simulations benefit from both the organization and performance aspects of ECS; after all, what are video games but complex, not very realistic simulations?\nWe want to build an ECS-based physics engine that utilizes all of ECS's benefits and is easy for non-professional software engineers to use. Historically, writing code that utilizes vectorized operations was a harrowing manual process. Engineers had to write code in an obscure, often difficult-to-read way (https://mcyoung.xyz/2023/11/27/simd-base64/). While the results were very performant, they were not very readable. Simulation code is already difficult to understand due to its heavy reliance on often obscure mathematical methods. Adding complex performance optimizations to that is a recipe for confusion.\nThankfully, there is another math-heavy field that deals with this exact problem – Machine Learning (ML). There are several systems built for machine learning that allow efficient vectorized operations without sacrificing readability. We will focus on two related projects, JAX and XLA. XLA is a compiler that compiles linear algebra operations to GPU, CPU, or TPU. JAX is a JIT for Python that turns standard numpy operations into XLA intermediate representation called StableHLO – technically, it uses MHLO, which is a compatible but distinct IR to StableHLO, which is then converted by XLA into StableHLO. JAX is wonderful because it allows anyone comfortable with Numpy to write efficient code for the GPU. Python is quickly becoming the lingua franca of scientific programming, so this feature is of particular interest.\nOur simulation engine works by merging ECS and Jax into a unified platform. We have ported a subset of Jax's features to Rust, a system we call Nox. Here is an example of how to write a basic six DOF (degrees-of-freedom) physics engine using Nox and our ECS.\n\nLet's walk through what's happening here, and how it works.\nThe first code block is dedicated to setting up all the components required for a six-dof system.\nYou'll see references to SpatialPos, SpatialMotion, and SpatialForce.\nThese are from Featherstone's Spatial Vector Algebra and are a compact way of representing the state of a rigid body with six degrees of freedom.\nYou can read a short intro here or in Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms (Featherstone - 2008).\nNext, you see the Body struct, which is an Archetype, which is a collection of different components that will be found together in an ECS. It allows us to initialize all the components together.\nThen you can see calculate_accel, a function that takes the external forces and torques (SpatialForce contains both) acting on an object and converts them to accelerations.\nThen we spawn a single body into the World, a collection of entities and associated components.\nThen, we build an executable from that world and our systems. You can see that we call a method called rk4 on calculate_accel. RK4 refers to Runga Kutta 4, a widely used integrator for differential equations. RK4 works with differential equations in the form:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt}=f(t,u),\\quad u(t_0)=u_0\n$$\nIn the function call, you can see two generic parameters (2 tuples). The first specifies which components make up $u$ and the second specifies which components make up $\\frac{du}{dt}$\nAs you can see, we have built a fairly simple but complete physics simulation in 34 lines of code. It can run on GPU, CPU, or TPU (Tensor Processing Unit).\nRunning seamlessly on GPUs is not the only nice benefit of our ECS-based Physics engine. You can also see the type-safety that coding like this provides. Math-heavy code can easily fall victim to type errors when everything is stored in untyped matrices. After all, position and velocity are both just vectors of floats and especially when combined with dense shorthand notation, the room for error is immense. Our ECS system uses typing to guide the reader and writer, ensuring that type errors do not occur.\nWe plan to provide several prebuilt simulation pipelines and components, including a version of the popular MuJoCo algorithm and the algorithm used in the Basilisk Astrodynamics framework.\n","id":"/home/tao/ecs/","title":"Why ECS for Physics?"},"/home/tao/introduction/":{"body":"Hardware is Hard\nIf you've ever built anything with hardware involved you know it is incredibly time-consuming. Even the simplest of projects can spiral out of control.\nNever is this more true than for aerospace projects. Satellites have historically taken around 10 years to produce, and even now it can take over a year to produce a simple CubeSat. Drones are usually much quicker to produce, but can still take over a year to make a fully featured drone platform. Rockets, airplanes, and helicopters take this to an even bigger extreme.\nThere are some excellent reasons these projects take so long to produce; they are complex – typically made by large teams of people, often breaking new ground on technology. That's the inherent complexity, the complexity that makes these problems worth solving. There is also the incidental complexity, the complexity that is not required and just comes along for the ride. Elodin's goal is to solve that incidental complexity, starting with a simulation and test platform.\nThe Elodin Way\nElodin's simulation system has 4 primary components:\n\nAn ECS based physics toolkit that allows you to use JAX or Rust to write GPU-backed simulations.\nA cloud Monte Carlo runner, that enables users to run massive numbers of their simulations in parallel.\nA 3D viewer that allows you to visualize your simulation in realtime.\nA communication protocol that links together the simulation, flight control software, and the data-collection system.\n\n","id":"/home/tao/introduction/","title":"What is Elodin"},"/home/tao/jax-nox/":{"body":"When setting about to develop an open and composable physics engine, deciding how to support numerical computation in an efficient and\nexpressive manner was a key exploration. An obvious inspiration we looked to was the Python NumPy ecosystem.\nIf you're not familiar with NumPy, imagine you're working with a massive dataset or a matrix of numbers, and you need to perform calculations\nefficiently. Normally, doing that with regular Python lists would be slow and memory-hungry. Enter NumPy: a tool\nfor high-performance number crunching in Python. NumPy solves this problem by offloading expensive math operations to a fast hyper-optimized C library.\nNumPy gives you ndarrays, which are multi-dimensional arrays that are faster and more memory-efficient than Python's built-in lists. You can\nalso do vectorized operations on these arrays—so instead of writing loops to process each element, NumPy lets you apply operations to entire\narrays at once, like performing element-wise math in parallel. NumPy's core innovation is that it lets you perform vectorized operations on\nmulti-dimensional arrays. A vectorized operation means that the CPU operates on multiple entries in an array simultaneously. NumPy's syntax\nis also less verbose – so instead of writing [2 * x for x in array] you can just write 2 * array and NumPy handles the rest for you.\nIt's also the backbone for other major scientific libraries like SciPy and pandas. NumPy is the most popular way of expressing math in\nPython. It's commonly used in virtually every field, and has developed a large eco-system of libraries.\nAs a result, NumPy has become a staple for numerical computation across schools and industries.\nJAX\nNumPy sounds great! So why not use it for Elodin?\nMillions of simulations running in parallel is a common use case for Elodin. When you are trying to perform a large series of mathematical\nexpressions, finding a way to optimize becomes important. That's where JAX comes in.\nJAX is like NumPy’s supercharged cousin. It gives you all the things you love about NumPy—fast, efficient array operations—but with some\ngame-changing extras that make it ideal for machine learning and other performance-heavy tasks.\nAutomatic Differentiation\nFirst, JAX can automatically compute derivatives of functions, which is super useful for things like training neural networks. You can\ndefine a function, and JAX will figure out how to differentiate it for you, no extra coding required. This is called automatic differentiation,\npopular in machine learning because finding the gradient of a function is crucial for training neural networks.\nJust-in-Time Compilation\nSecond, JAX uses something called just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Normally, when you run Python code, it’s interpreted line by line,\nwhich can be slow. But JAX can take your code and compile it to run way faster, like low-level machine code. So you get the flexibility of\nPython but with near-C++ performance.\nGPU &amp; TPU Acceleration\nThird, it can easily run your computations on GPUs and TPUs by compiling to XLA, without you having to manage\nall that complexity. You just write Python code, and JAX handles sending it to the GPU in the background.\nJAX is like NumPy, but optimized for high-performance computing, like running massive monte-carlo simulations.\nNox\nEnter Nox, a Rust implementation of JAX. Nox is a Rust library that provides a NumPy-like interface for numerical computing, but with the\nperformance and power of JAX. It's a Rust port of JAX, which means you can write your code in Rust and get all the benefits of JAX, like\nautomatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation.\nJAX sounded great! So why re-write JAX in Rust to create Nox? For us, it boils down to 3 reasons.\nPerformance\nOne is that the JAX tracing process can get a little slow for more complex programs. By bringing Jaxprs into Rust, we can optimize the\ncompile path more. This doesn't matter for small simple programs, but for larger programs (especially with lots of unrolling) it could matter a lot.\nProduction-Ready\nThe 2nd reason is that we prefer Rust for making production-ready software. The strong type-system especially allows you to catch many errors\nat compile time, and while Python is moving in that direction, it isn't there yet.\nIntegration\nThe 3rd reason is that we want this software to easily integrate with your existing flight software (the control software for your drone/satellite),\nand using a \"systems\" language like Rust makes that easier. Eventually, we would love to build out a suite of flight software in Rust that can easily\nintegrate with the simulation but is still flight-ready.\nA fun side-effect of this architecture is Nox allows you to write code for both simulations and flight software generically, allowing for seamless\n\"software in the loop\" and \"hardware in the loop\" testing of your flight software.\nAnd The \"Sharp Bits\"\nWhile it's tempting dive in thinking the use of JAX/NOX in Elodin will be just like NumPy, the\nSharp Bits still apply, namely:\nImmutable Arrays\nIn JAX, once you create an array, you can’t change it directly. Think of it like a \"look but don’t touch\" rule. Instead of modifying an\narray in place, JAX forces you to create new arrays with your changes. This can feel weird if you’re used to NumPy, where you can just tweak\nthings in-place. The immutability is important for making sure JAX’s optimizations work smoothly, but it takes a bit of getting used to.\nPure Functions, No Side Effects\nJAX loves pure functions—meaning no messing around with global variables, no printing from inside the function, nothing that changes outside\nthe function's scope. It sounds strict, but it’s necessary for JAX’s magic, like automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation, to\nwork properly. So, if you try to sneak in a print statement while debugging, JAX will throw a fit!\nSubtle Differences from NumPy\nJAX feels a lot like NumPy, but there are some small gotchas. For example, some NumPy functions you’re used to might be missing or work a\nlittle differently. JAX is really built for numbers and arrays—if you try to work with anything else, like random Python objects, JAX won’t be happy.\n","id":"/home/tao/jax-nox/","title":"NumPy, JAX & NOX"},"/home/tao/monte-carlo/":{"body":"With our physics toolkit, you can simulate a wide variety of physical situations. But what's the point of making these simulations?\nOur primary goal is to test control systems for aerospace vehicles.\nIt's not sufficient to test the control systems in just one situation; you need to test them across the entire gamut of possible outcomes.\nTo do that, you can use Monte Carlo testing. Monte Carlo is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the famous Monaco casino.\nThe name originated in the depths of the Manhattan Project during WW2, where they needed a clandestine name to mask the details of the technique.\nAs the name would suggest, Monte Carlo methods work by randomly sampling a system. In this case, the random sampling is of the control system and simulations. You randomize a set of input values to the simulation and then record outputs for each iteration.\nMonte Carlo Challenges\nMonte Carlo systems are commonly used, but they can be particularly challenging for traditional simulation systems.\nMost systems allow you to randomize inputs into the system, but they make it far more challenging to run many simulations in parallel.\nMatLab's license model makes it prohibitively expensive to run parallel simulations.\nOther solutions simply require large amounts of engineering effort and/or massive amounts of computing power to run simulations in parallel.\nOur Solution\nElodin solves these problems by introducing a cloud-based simulation runner that can run up to 100,000 simulations simultaneously. We're able to do so in a cost-effective way by:\n\nUsing the ECS architecture to exploit the inherent parallelism in running the same compute kernel against different sets of data.\nLeveraging XLA to compile the simulation code to run on GPUs.\nUsing the cloud's elasticity to scale up and down as needed.\n\n","id":"/home/tao/monte-carlo/","title":"Monte Carlo"},"/reference/coords/":{"body":"The default coordinate systems used in Elodin align with the editor's representation of the (X, Y, Z)\naxes as (red, green, blue) respectively.

This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution, and likely a symptom of needing to move your testing into your flight software &amp; communicate with the simulation over Impel.\n\n    \n\n\n\nComponents\nComponents are containers of data that is associated with an entity. See ECS Data Model for more context on entities and components.\nTo define a new component, add elodin.Component as metadata to a base class using typing.Annotated. The base class can be jax.Array or some other container of array data. This is an example of a component that annotates jax.Array:\n\nclass elodin.Component\nA container of component metadata.\n\n\n__init__(name, type = None, asset = False, metadata = {}) -&gt; elodin.Component\nCreate a new component with:\n\nUnique name (e.g. \"world_pos, \"inertia\").\nComponent type information (via elodin.ComponentType). This is optional if the base class already provides component type information as part of __metadata__, which is the case for elodin.Quaternion, elodin.Edge, and all spatial vector algebra classes.\nFlag indicating whether the component is an asset (e.g. a mesh, texture, etc.).\nOther metadata that is optional (e.g. description, units, labels, etc.).\n\n\nThe above example defines a \"wind\" component that is a 3D vector of float64 values. The \"element_names\" entry is an example of optional metadata. It specifies the labels for each element of the vector that are displayed in the component inspector.\n\n\nComponent.name(component) -&gt; string\nThe unique name of the component.\n\n\nComponent.index(component) -&gt; elodin.ShapeIndexer\nA shape indexer that can be used to access the component data.\n\n\nclass elodin.ComponentType\nComponentType describes the shape and data type of a component. The shape is a tuple of integers that specifies the size of each dimension (e.g. () for scalars, (3,) for 3D vectors). The data type is an elodin.PrimitiveType.\n\n\n__init__(dtype, shape) -&gt; elodin.ComponentType\nCreate a component type from a data type and shape.\n\n\nclass elodin.Edge\nAn edge is a relationship between two entities. See elodin.GraphQuery for information on how to use edges in graph queries.\n\n\n__init__(left, right) -&gt; elodin.Edge\nCreate an edge between two entities given their unique ids.\n\n\n\nArchetypes\nAn archetype is a combination of components with a unique name. To define a new archetype, create a subclass of elodin.Archetype with the desired components as fields. Here is an example of an archetype for a kalman filter:\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        To automatically generate __init__(), you can use the @dataclass decorator.\n\n    \n\n\nThe archetype can then be used to attach components to entities:\n\n\nSystems\nSystems are the building blocks of simulation; they are functions that operate on a set of input components and produce a set of output components. Elodin provides decorators that allow for systems to be easily defined from functions.\n@elodin.system\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        This is a lower-level primitive; for many cases @elodin.map – a wrapper around @elodin.system – is easier to use.\n\n    \n\nThis is a lower-level API for defining a system. A function decorated with @elodin.system accepts special parameter types (such as elodin.Query and elodin.GraphQuery) that specify what data the system needs access to. It returns an elodin.Query containing one or more components. Some examples of @elodin.system are:\n\n@elodin.map\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Graph queries cannot be used with @elodin.map. Use @elodin.system instead.\n\n    \n\nThis is a higher-level API for defining a system that reduces the boilerplate of @elodin.system by unpacking the input and output queries into individual components, and wrapping the body of the function in a query.map(ret_type, ...) call. It is useful for systems with simple data flow patterns. Some examples of @elodin.map are:\n\nThe following systems are equivalent as the @elodin.map definition effectively desugars to the @elodin.system one:\n\nclass elodin.Query\nQuery is the primary mechanism for accessing data in Elodin. It is a view into the world state that is filtered by the components specified in the query. Only entities that have been spawned with all of the query's components will be selected for processing. For example, the query Query[WorldPos, Inertia] would only select entities that have both a WorldPos and an Inertia component (typically via the Body archetype).\n\n\nmap(ret_type, map_fn) -&gt; elodin.Query\nApply a function map_fn to the query's components and return a new query with the specified ret_type return type. map_fn should be a function that takes the query's components as arguments and returns a single value of type ret_type.\n\nIn this example, ret_type is el.Force and map_fn is a lambda function with the signature (el.Force, el.Inertia) -&gt; el.Force.\nTo return multiple components as output, ret_type must be a tuple:\n\n\n\nclass elodin.GraphQuery\nGraphQuery is a special type of query for operating on edges in an entity graph. Edges represent relationships between entities and are fundamental for modeling physics systems such as gravity.\nA GraphQuery requires exactly one type argument, which must be an annotated elodin.Edge component. For example, GraphQuery[GravityEdge] is a valid graph query if GravityEdge is a component with Edge as the base class:\n\n\n\nedge_fold(left_query, right_query, return_type, init_value, fold_fn) -&gt; elodin.Query\nFor each edge, query the left and right entity components using left_query and right_query, respectively. Then, apply the fold_fn function to those input components to compute the return_type output component(s).\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        The return_type component(s) must belong to the left entity of the edge.\n\n    \n\nA single left entity may have edges to multiple right entities, but it can only hold a single value for each return_type component. So, the fold_fn computations for each entity's edges must be accumulated into a single final value. To carry the intermediate results, fold_fn takes an \"accumulator\" value as the first argument. Its output is set as the accumulator value for the next iteration. init_value is the initial value of the accumulator.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        edge_fold makes no guarantees about the order in which edges are processed. For associative operators like +, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative operators like -, the order will affect the final result.\n\n    \n\nSee the Three-Body Orbit Tutorial for a practical example of using edge_fold to compute gravitational forces between entities.\n\n\n\nPrimitives\nclass elodin.PrimitiveType\n\n\nelodin.PrimitiveType.F64 -&gt; elodin.PrimitiveType\nA constant representing the 64-bit floating point data type.\n\n\nelodin.PrimitiveType.U64 -&gt; elodin.PrimitiveType\nA constant representing the 64-bit unsigned integer data type.\n\n\nclass elodin.Quaternion\nUnit quaternions are used to represent spatial orientations and rotations of bodies in 3D space.\n\n\nQuaternion.identity() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nCreate a unit quaternion with no rotation.\n\n\nQuaternion.from_axis_angle() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nCreate a quaternion from an axis and an angle.\n\n\ninverse() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nCompute the inverse of the quaternion.\n\n\nnormalize() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nNormalize to a unit quaternion.\n\n\nintegrate_body(body_delta) -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nPerform quaternion integration in body-frame with angular velocity body_delta, which must be a 3D vector.\n\n\n__add__(other) -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nAdd two quaternions.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Adding quaternions does not yield the composite rotation unless they are infinitesimal rotations, use multiplication instead.\n\n    \n\n\n\n__mul__(other) -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nMultiply two quaternions.\n\n\n__matmul__(vector) -&gt; jax.Array | elodin.SpatialTransform | elodin.SpatialMotion | elodin.SpatialForce\nRotate vector by computing the matrix product. The vector can be a plain jax.Array or one of the following spatial objects: elodin.SpatialTransform, elodin.SpatialMotion, elodin.SpatialForce. The return type is the same as the input type.\n\n\n\nSpatial Vector Algebra\nElodin uses Featherstone’s spatial vector algebra notation for rigid-body dynamics as it is a compact way of representing the state of a rigid body with six degrees of freedom. You can read a short into here or in Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms (Featherstone - 2008).\nclass elodin.SpatialTransform\nA spatial transform is a 7D vector that represents a rigid body transformation in 3D space.\n\n\n__init__(arr, angular, linear) -&gt; elodin.SpatialTransform\nCreate a spatial transform from either arr or angular and linear.

This data can be used to replay the simulation at a later time. This is useful for debugging, testing, and sharing simulations. Replays also enable running simulations in a headless environment, and then replaying them in a graphical environment.\nTo replay a simulation using the Elodin editor, run the following command:\n\nFile Layout\nAn Elodin replay directory contains:\n\nmetadata.json\nassets.bin\nComponent data Parquet files\n\nmetadata.json\nThis file contains all of the metadata that is needed to replay the simulation.

See Well-Known Assets for some examples. Archetypes are often used to link entities to assets by using the asset handle as scalar component data. Some examples of such archetypes are shape, asset_handle_panel, and asset_handle_entity_metadata.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        This file format is currently not suitable for consumption by external tools and is subject to change in the future.\n\n    \n\nComponent data Parquet files\nEach Archetype in the simulation has a Parquet file named after it. The file contains the component data for each entity of that archetype. There is a row for each entity at every tick of the simulation. There are special columns in the Parquet file that are used to store the entity ID and the tick number: \"entity_id\" and \"tick\" respectively. The rest of the columns are the components of the archetype. E.g.:\n\nIn this simplified example, there is a single entity with two components: world_pos and world_vel. The entity has an ID of 0, and the simulation has run for three ticks.\nWell-Known Archetypes\nbody\nbody is a core archetype that's used in most Elodin simulations. It represents the state of a rigid body with six degrees of freedom, and is used by the built-in 6DOF integrators to propagate the simulation forward in time. It also contains most of the necessary information to render the body in a graphical environment. The components of the Body archetype are:\n\nworld_pos: A SpatialTransform representing the body's position and orientation in the world frame.\nworld_vel: A SpatialMotion representing the body's linear and angular velocity in the world frame.\nworld_accel: A SpatialMotion representing the body's linear and angular acceleration in the world frame.\nforce: A SpatialForce representing the net force and torque acting on the body in the world frame.\ninertia: A SpatialInertia representing the body's mass, moment of inertia, and momentum in the body frame.\n\nshape\nshape represents the primitive shape and color of a body. It serves as a link between entity ids and asset ids, as can be seen from its components:\n\nasset_handle_material: A u64 handle to a Material asset.\nasset_handle_mesh: A u64 handle to a Mesh asset.\n\nasset_handle_panel\nasset_handle_panel links an entity to a panel asset. It only has one component: asset_handle_panel, which is a u64 handle to a [Panel] asset.\nasset_handle_entity_metadata\nasset_handle_entity_metadata links an entity to a metadata asset. It only has one component: asset_handle_entity_metadata, which is a u64 handle to a metadata asset.\nWell-Known Assets\nMesh\nMesh assets describe the geometry of a body. Currently, the mesh must be a primitive shape, such as a sphere, box, or cylinder.\nMaterial\nMaterial assets describe the color and texture of a body. Currently, the material must be a solid color.\nGLB\nGLB assets are 3D models in the GLB format. They can be used to represent complex geometries and textures.\nPanel\nPanel assets describe the layout and contents of the Elodin GUI declaratively.

For example to setup a stream that calculates the mean of every 10 values:\n\n\n\nAdd CSV as an archive data format. From elodin-db lua: client:save_archive(\"path/to/dir\", \"csv\").\n\n\nDon't add \"Globals\" entity + \"Tick\" component on elodin-db initialization. This entity and component are only required for simulation purposes, not HITL.\n\n\nv0.13\nv0.13.3\n\n(fix) Fix a bug where the db/editor's time window would be smaller than the actual data's time window.\n\nv0.13.2\n\n(fix) Fix a bug where the dump schema and dump metadata responses didn't include the request id.\n\nv0.13.1\n\n(fix) Fix a bug where the db wouldn't stream data to the editor correctly when there's a vtable that's registered but not used.\n\nv0.13.0\n\n(breaking) Remove exec.write_to_dir(path). This is made obsolete by the new SaveArchive method in elodin-db.\n(fix) Fix an issue where the component inspector would show incorrect data for some multi-dimensional components.\n\nv0.12\nv0.12.3\n\n(feat) Add \"presets\" to the editor. Presets allow you to save your current editor layout (graphs, viewports, etc), and load them later\n(feat) add SaveArchive method to db that allows saving arrow ipc or parquet archives\nSaveArchive will dump the current contents of the database to the file system at the specified path. By default this uses arrow-ipc as the file format, but it can be switched to use parquet\n(feat) add C++ code generation to elodin-db\n\nv0.12.2\n\n(breaking) Make the elodin-db HTTP server optional. If an explicit --http-addr argument is not provided, the HTTP server will not be started.\nAdd UDP unicast support to elodin-db. Configure using the UdpUnicast message.\nAdd ability to mirror elodin-db over UDP unicast. Simply configure one db instance to stream data to another db instance's listen address.\n\nv0.12.1\n\n(feat) Add HTTP API to elodin-db.\n\nv0.12.0\n\n(breaking) Add a request_id field to PacketHeader and shorten PacketId to [u8; 3]. In order to support better request-reply semantics, a u8 request_id was added to PacketHeader.\n(breaking) The primitive types in the lua api have been lowercased so F64 is now f64 and so on.\n(breaking) When using send_msg and send_msgs you no longer have to call :msg() on every msg. See the updated examples/db-config.lua for the new API\n(feat:db) Add support for recording data at timestamps to elodin-db\nelodin-db now no longer operates on the concept of \"ticks\". Instead each new value is recorded as a pair of timestamp and value. This essentially makes elodin-db into a timer series database. It also fixes the problem where elodin-db would record a new entry, even when the value is unchanged.\n(feat) Add support for SQL queries in elodin-db. These can be accessed from the CLI using the :sql command or through the editor using the new SQL pane. We used datafusion-sql to implement SQL support. You can find their docs here (https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/index.html) for the syntax.\n(feat) Add startup screen to editor that allows connecting to elodin-db or simulations, and running sims from files\n(feat:editor) The component monitor UI has been redesigned to be easier to read\n(feat) Add touch screen support to plots\n(fix) Fix plotting x axis tick marks placed in the wrong position\n\nv0.11\nv0.11.3\n\n(fix) Fix bug where it wasn't possible to set entity or component metadata from Lua config. The following should now work:\n\n(fix) Fix an issue where a panic could be caused when a stellarator executor was dropped from a thread local. Now the executor is manually dropped when stellarator::run finished.\n\nv0.11.2\n\n(breaking) Replace message-specific elodin-db Lua methods with generic send_msg() and send_msgs().\n(breaking) Reduce impeller packet header size from 16 bytes to 8 bytes. The len field is now a u32 instead of a u64. The req_id field has also been removed.\nAdd a --config argument to elodin-db run to provide a custom Lua config file that can pre-configure the database with necessary vtables and metadata.\n\nv0.11.1\n\n(fix) Fix bug where live reload would fail with an \"Address already in use\" error.\n(fix) Fix bug where duplicate panels would be created on live reload.\n\nv0.11.0\n\n(breaking) Add required component_name and entity_id arguments to Exec.history function.\nChange playback speed in the editor using the \"Set Playback Speed\" command in the command palette.\nDisplay plot data as soon as it is available rather than waiting for the simulation playback.\n\nv0.10\nv0.10.1\n\nAdd EGM2008 gravity model to the Python API.\n\nv0.10.0\n\n(breaking) Add \"optimize\" as an optional argument to World.run (defaults to False). This will enable additional optimization passes on the simulation code, which results in faster simulation run times at the cost of slower simulation startup times. This is useful for rapidly iterating on simulation code.\n(breaking) Replace \"output_time_step\" with \"default_playback_speed\" in World.run. This argument sets the default playback speed of the simulation in the editor. A value of 1.0 means that the simulation will run in real-time. A value of 0.5 means that the simulation will run at half speed, and so on.\nExpose more default arguments via type hints.\n\nv0.9\nv0.9.0\n\n(breaking) Remove deprecated time_step argument from World.run. Use sim_time_step instead.\n\nv0.8\nv0.8.0\n\n(breaking) Remove deprecated from_linear, from_angular, and zero static methods from spatial types. Use the constructor instead with optional arguments.\n\nv0.7\nv0.7.4\n\n(fix) Fix bug where editor run would fail if the simulation file was in the current directory because it would attempt to get the parent directory without canonicalizing the path.\n(fix) Fix elodin login in WSL. Previously, it would fail when attempting to open the browser. Now, it will print the URL to the console and you can copy and paste it into your browser.\n\nv0.7.2\n\nUse logical scan codes for the editor's key bindings. This means that keyboard shortcuts will respect your keyboard layout. For example, if you remap your Caps Lock key to Ctrl, the editor will treat Caps Lock as Ctrl as well.\n\nv0.7.1\n\nOn Windows, use Ctrl instead of Super for launching the command palette (Ctrl + P).\n\nv0.7.0\n\n(breaking) Replace --watch option with elodin run.\nAs part of adding process supervision to Elodin, we refactored how watching a simulation works. Now instead of running python3 sim.py run --watch, you run elodin run sim.py.\nAdd locking axis when panning and zooming plots.\nNow you can just move the x or y axis when panning or zooming a plot. Hold down Ctrl to only move along the x axis, and hold down Shift to only move along the y axis.\nAdd ability to run processes alongside simulations.\nYou can now add sidecar processes that are started alongside the main simulation. This is super useful for testing out flight software alongside your simulation.\n\n\nv0.6\nv0.6.2\n\n(fix) Various WASM editor bug fixes.\n\nv0.5\nv0.5.0\n\n(fix) Fix inconsistent axes colors in the editor. Now, +X is red, +Y is green, and +Z is blue across both the navigation widget and the grid lines.\nRespect .gitignore when uploading simulation artifacts for monte carlo runs. Also, ignore hidden files and directories.\n\nv0.4\nv0.4.1\n\nAdd local cache for remote GLB assets to improve model load times and reduce network usage.\nAdd more built-in templates for creating new simulations (ball and drone).\n\nv0.4.0\n\n(fix) Fix cutoff titlebar in editor on browser and windows.\n(fix) Fix bug in the drone example's rate controller where the derivative term wasn't filtered correctly (https://github.com/elodin-sys/elodin/issues/18). It effectively caused the integral gain to amplified and the derivative gain to be suppressed.\n(breaking) Replace el.Time and el.advance_time with el.SimulationTick and el.SimulationTimeStep.\n\nThe simulation tick is automatically advanced by a built-in system.\nThe simulation time step is set to the same value as the \"sim_time_step\" provided in World.run.\n\n\nAdd a built-in SystemGlobals archetype that is automatically spawned for every simulation.\n\nThis archetype is only associated with a single managed entity and contains global variables that can be accessed by any system.\nCurrently, it contains el.SimulationTick and el.SimulationTimeStep which are automatically set to the current tick and simulation time step respectively.\n\n\nAdd icon for the editor on windows.\nAdd support for panning and zooming plots in the editor.\nEnable vsync on Windows and Linux.\nDon't throttle FPS when cursor is not moving on Windows and Linux.\n\nv0.3\nv0.3.30\n\n(fix) Fix issue where edge_fold would not filter out edges where the \"right\" entity doesn't match the \"right\" query.\n\nv0.3.29\n\nSupport adding el.SpatialMotion to el.SpatialTransform.\nAdd body-frame quaternion integration to el.Quaternion via integrate_body.\n\nv0.3.28\n\nVarious bug fixes.\n\nv0.3.27\n\n(fix) Set the correct type information for the return value of el.Quaternion __matmul__. Previously, it would always return a jax.BatchTracer even if a spatial type was being multiplied.\n(fix) Fix issue where CLI is unable to verify the license key.\n\nv0.3.26\n\nImprove simulation startup times.\n\nv0.3.25\n\n(breaking) Use variable positional arguments for el.Panel.vsplit, el.Panel.hsplit, el.Panel.graph, and el.GraphEntity instead of lists. This results in much less verbose panel configuration code. To update your code, either replace the list of arguments with individual arguments separated by commas or unpack the list with *.\n\n(fix): Fix editor crash on Windows due to:\n\nRequested alpha mode PostMultiplied is not in the list of supported alpha modes: [Opaque]\n\n\nGraphEntity constructor now accepts component classes directly instead of el.Component.index(ComponentClass). However, el.Component.index is still needed for slicing and indexing into individual elements of a component.\n\nAdd better default names for viewports and graphs. E.g. Track: \"&lt;entity\nname&gt;\" for viewports and \"&lt;entity name&gt;: &lt;component name&gt;\" for graphs.\nAdd basic support for 3D plots/traces in the editor.\n\nTrace an entity's position by spawning in elodin.Line3d assets:\n\n\n\n\nv0.3.24\n\nDecouple simulation and playback running. You can now pause and rewind the editor without pausing the simulation. You can also change the playback speed by using output_time_step on WorldBuilder.run. We are deprecating the time_step parameter and replacing it with sim_time_step. This is to disambiguate it with run_time_step, which allows you to control the amount of time elodin waits between ticks of the simulation. Setting run_time_step to 0.0 effectively lets you simulate maximum speed.\nAdd max_ticks parameter to WorldBuilder.run. The simulation will run until the specified number of ticks is reached.\nAdd body frame visualization option.\nTo try it out, either open the command palette and type Toggle Body Axes or add the following code to your simulation file:\n\nAdd the ability to create graphs and viewports entirely from the command palette. Try spawning a new graph by typing Create Graph, to see the new workflow.\n(fix) If there were pytest failures in a  Monte Carlo sample, the sample would still be reported as a pass. This is now fixed.\n(fix) Fix line pixelation in long-running plots.\nAdd SpatialTransform() constructor that replaces SpatialTransform.zero(), SpatialTransform.from_linear(linear), and SpatialTransform.from_angular(quaternion) by making use of optional arguments. The old methods are still available but deprecated.\n\nAdd SpatialForce() constructor that replaces SpatialForce.zero(), SpatialForce.from_linear(linear), and SpatialForce.from_torque(torque) by making use of optional arguments. The old methods are still available but deprecated.\n\nDeprecate SpatialTransform.from_axis_angle(axis, angle) in favor of SpatialTransform(angular=Quaternion.from_axis_angle(axis, angle)).\nDeprecate SpatialMotion.from_linear(linear) and SpatialMotion.from_angular(angular) in favor of SpatialMotion(linear=linear, angular=angular).\nAdd filtered search for entities and components.\nAlways include zero as a tick in the y-axis of plots.\nReplace \"Welcome\" panel with a new UI for creating viewports and graphs.\nAdd \"Save Replay\" command to command palette (Cmd + P).\nShow progress bar when executing exec.run(ticks) unless explicitly disabled with exec.run(ticks, show_progress=False).\nAdd a create command for templates to the Elodin CLI\nAllowing naming of viewports and graphs from code.\n\n\nv0.3.23\n\n(breaking) Render the Z-axis as up in the editor (instead of the Y-axis). This is a purely visual change and does not affect simulation results, but it's recommended to update simulations to match the new visual orientation. Typically, this requires swapping the Y and Z axes when operating on spatial positions, velocities, and forces.\n(fix) When a simulation file was changed, the associated pycache files would also be updated, causing the simulation to be re-built multiple times in some cases. This is now fixed.\nAdd Status Bar to the editor (currently shows FPS/TPS and basic version of the connection status).\nelodin editor &lt;path/to/sim&gt; now watches the parent directory of the simulation file for changes in addition to the file itself. This is useful for multi-file projects. This is also the case when using the --watch flag directly. E.g. python &lt;path/to/sim&gt; run --watch.\nExport simulation data to a directory using exec.write_to_dir(path).\n\nv0.3.22\n\n(fix) Fix errors when using vmap with scan, and non-scalar values\n\nWhen the arguments to a scan operation were non-scalar values (i.e their rank was above 0), scan would error in various ways when combined with vmap. The core issue is that some of our logic accidentally assumed an empty shape array, and when that array was non-empty, dimensions would be inserted into the wrong place.\n\n\n\nv0.3.21\n\n(fix) Fix missing 1/2 factor in angular velocity integration and Quaternion::from_axis_angle .\n\nIn nox, the constant Field::two returned a 1 constant. This constant was only used in the implementation of Add between SpatialMotion and SpatialTransform and in Quaternion::from_axis_angle. Unfortunately, this caused angular velocity integration to return incorrect results. This bug caused the applied angular velocity to be multiplied by a factor of 2.\nThe most significant impact of this bug is on the stability of any attitude control system. This bug has led to an increase in small oscillations, potentially affecting the performance of PID controllers tuned to work with previous versions of Elodin. PID controllers tuned to work with earlier versions of Elodin will likely need to be re-tuned\nWe regret not catching this bug earlier. To prevent a bug like this happening ever again, we have taken the following steps:\n\nWe created a set of unit tests for the 6 DOF implementation that compare Elodin's results with Simulink. They have confirmed that our implementation now matched Simulink's 6DOF Quaternion block.\nWe will expand our set of unit tests to have 100% coverage of our math modules. We will test each module against Simulink and other trusted implementations.\nWe will publish documentation on our testing methodology and reports for each module.\n\n\n\n\n(fix) Fix incorrect angular acceleration due to mismatched coordinate frames.\n\nSpatial force and motion are defined in the world frame. The inertia tensor, however, is defined in the body frame. To correctly calculate angular acceleration, torque and inertia tensor must be in the same frame. To fix this, we now transform torque from the world frame to the body frame before calculating angular acceleration. Then, we transform the angular acceleration back to the world frame.\n\n\n(breaking) Split el.Pbr into el.Mesh, el.Material, el.Shape, and el.Glb.\n\nUse the el.shape and el.glb helpers instead\n\n\n\n(breaking) Remove SpatialInertia.from_mass().\n\nUse the SpatialInertia() constructor instead, which now accepts inertia tensor as an optional keyword argument.\n\n\n\nIf a Component base class provides ComponentType information via __metadata__, then it can be omitted from the Component(...) annotation as it can be inferred from the base class instead.\n\nQuaternion, Handle, Edge, and all spatial classes (SpatialTransform, SpatialForce, SpatialMotion, SpatialInertia) have been updated to provide ComponentType information directly. So, components that annotate these classes can now be defined more simply:\n\n\n\nAdd visualization of the current tick in the graph views of the editor.\nAdd TotalEdge, an edge type that connects every entity to every other entity.\nFix issue where stepping backwards or forwards in the editor would sometimes not work.\nAdd Command Palette to the editor\n\nv0.3.20\n\n(breaking) Replace entity builder pattern with a more flexible spawn API.\n\nTo migrate to the new API, replace name() with the keyword argument:\n\nIf the entity has multiple archetypes, just provide a list of archetypes as the first positional argument instead of using insert():\n\nAlso, spawn now returns EntityId directly instead of Entity. So, there's no need to call id() to reference the entity in an edge component or viewport.\n\n\n\nAdd multi-file support for Monte Carlo runs.\nAdd ability to use ranges in viewports for replay.\n\nv0.3.19\n\n(breaking) Allow querying different components from the left and right entities via the new edge_fold API.\n\nTo migrate to the new API, move the graph query's input components to a separate query parameter:\nAnd then reference it in edge_fold:\n\nTo query different components from the left and right entities, use multiple queries:\n\n\n\nMake graph colors deterministic.\nDrop milliseconds from the x-axis in graphs.\nPrevent grid from changing origin.\nAdd ranges to graphs to allow zooming + panning.\nAdd support for spawning graphs and splits from code.\nSwitch to GPU based plotting.\nAdd configurable line width for graphs.\n\nv0.3.18\n\n(breaking) Make RK4 the default integrator (can still override to use semi-implicit euler).\nAdd element names to graphs.\nAdd component priorities.\nComponents in inspector are displayed in descending order of priority.\n\nPriority can be set via metadata. E.g.: metadata={\"element_names\": \"q0,q1,q2,q3,x,y,z\", \"priority\": 5}.\nDefault priority, if unset, is 10.\nComponents with priority of &lt; 0 are hidden from the inspector.\n\n\nIncrease y-axis margin in graphs to prevent axis labels from getting cut off.\nUse scientific notation for large values.\nPrevent graph cursor modal from being cut off.\nAdd interia_diag() helper to el.SpatialInertia.\nFix graph data interpolation issues.\n\nv0.3.17\n\nReduce memory usage of plots.\nAdd rocket example with thrust curve interpolation.\nClear graphs on sim update.\nHave a stable ordering of components in inspector.\nMake decimal point stable in component inspector.\nAdd a built-in Time component + system.\nRemember window size on restart.\nAdd configurable labels for component elements.\n\n","id":"/releases/changelog/","title":"Changelog"}},"docInfo":{"/home/3-body/":{"body":477,"title":3},"/home/aleph/betaflight/":{"body":152,"title":2},"/home/aleph/fc-board-flash/":{"body":136,"title":3},"/home/aleph/reset/":{"body":270,"title":2},"/home/aleph/setup/":{"body":481,"title":2},"/home/bouncing-ball/":{"body":791,"title":2},"/home/db/architecture/":{"body":381,"title":1},"/home/db/overview/":{"body":169,"title":1},"/home/quickstart/":{"body":165,"title":2},"/home/tao/data-flow/":{"body":154,"title":3},"/home/tao/ecs/":{"body":777,"title":2},"/home/tao/introduction/":{"body":146,"title":1},"/home/tao/jax-nox/":{"body":601,"title":3},"/home/tao/monte-carlo/":{"body":176,"title":2},"/reference/coords/":{"body":379,"title":2},"/reference/elodin-cli/":{"body":77,"title":2},"/reference/migration/to-0-15/":{"body":233,"title":2},"/reference/overview/":{"body":118,"title":1},"/reference/python-api/":{"body":1850,"title":2},"/reference/replays/":{"body":392,"title":1},"/releases/changelog/":{"body":2483,"title":1}},"length":21},"lang":"English"}

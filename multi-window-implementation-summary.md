# Multi-Window Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Core Window Management ✅
- Created `libs/elodin-editor/src/multi_window.rs` with:
  - `SecondaryWindowRequests` resource for tracking window creation requests
  - `SecondaryWindowHandle` component for tracking secondary windows
  - `WindowContent` enum for specifying panel content
  - `MultiWindowPlugin` with systems for spawning and managing windows
  - Support for creating 3D cameras for viewport panels
  - Window close event handling and resource cleanup

### Phase 2: Secondary Window Rendering (Partial) ⚠️
- Created `libs/elodin-editor/src/ui/secondary_window.rs` with:
  - `SecondaryWindowUiPlugin` for UI rendering
  - Basic structure for rendering panels in secondary windows
  - Viewport rect updating for secondary window cameras
  
**Note**: Full egui rendering in secondary windows is currently stubbed out due to `bevy_egui` limitations with multi-window contexts. The 3D viewport rendering should work, but UI panels need more work.

### Phase 3: Camera and Viewport Management ✅
- Implemented secondary window camera creation with:
  - Proper render target assignment to secondary windows
  - Render layers (Layer 1 for secondary windows)
  - Environment map lighting and bloom effects
  - Editor camera controls

### Phase 4: User Interface Integration ✅
- Added pop-out functionality to the tile system:
  - New `TreeAction::PopOutPane` variant
  - Pop-out button ("⧉") in tab UI with hover tooltip
  - Proper handling of popout actions with deferred processing
  - Automatic removal of pane from main window when popped out

### Phase 5: Event Handling (Partial) ⚠️
- Basic window lifecycle management implemented
- Window close events properly clean up resources
- State synchronization needs additional work

## Current Status

### Working Features
1. **Pop-out button**: Appears on all pane tabs in the main editor
2. **Window creation**: Secondary windows are spawned with proper Bevy configuration
3. **3D Viewport support**: Cameras are created and configured for viewport panes
4. **Resource management**: Windows and associated resources are properly tracked
5. **Clean compilation**: No errors or critical warnings

### Known Limitations

1. **egui Rendering**: 
   - `bevy_egui 0.34.0-rc.2` doesn't have built-in support for multiple window contexts
   - UI panels (Graph, Monitor, Inspector, etc.) won't render properly in secondary windows yet
   - Only 3D viewport content will display correctly

2. **Window Return**: 
   - No "pop-in" functionality to return panes to the main window
   - Once popped out, panes must be recreated in the main window

3. **State Synchronization**:
   - Time, selection, and playback state not fully synchronized between windows
   - Each window operates somewhat independently

## Testing

An example test application was created at `libs/elodin-editor/examples/multi_window_test.rs` for basic testing.

To test the implementation in the actual editor:
1. Run the Elodin editor
2. Click the "⧉" button on any pane tab
3. A secondary window should open (though UI content may not render)

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Fix egui multi-window rendering**:
   - Investigate `bevy_egui` patches or workarounds for multi-window support
   - Consider using raw winit events for secondary window UI
   - Or wait for bevy_egui to add official multi-window support

2. **Implement pop-in functionality**:
   - Add a way to return panes to the main window
   - Track original tile positions for restoration

3. **Complete state synchronization**:
   - Share `CurrentTimestamp`, `SelectedObject`, etc. between windows
   - Ensure playback controls affect all windows

### Medium Priority
1. **Window position/size persistence**:
   - Save secondary window positions and sizes
   - Restore layout on application restart

2. **Improved viewport synchronization**:
   - Synchronize camera positions between viewport windows
   - Share grid and gizmo settings

3. **Performance optimization**:
   - Profile multi-window rendering performance
   - Optimize render layer usage

### Low Priority
1. **Multiple secondary windows of same type**
2. **Drag-and-drop between windows**
3. **Window-specific settings and preferences**

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `libs/elodin-editor/src/multi_window.rs` - Core window management
- `libs/elodin-editor/src/ui/secondary_window.rs` - Secondary window UI
- `libs/elodin-editor/examples/multi_window_test.rs` - Test application

### Modified Files
- `libs/elodin-editor/src/lib.rs` - Added module and plugin registration
- `libs/elodin-editor/src/ui/mod.rs` - Added secondary_window module
- `libs/elodin-editor/src/ui/tiles.rs` - Added pop-out button and action handling

## Technical Notes

### Bevy Version
Using Bevy 0.16 with bevy_egui 0.34.0-rc.2

### Key Challenges
1. **bevy_egui limitations**: The crate doesn't currently support rendering egui to multiple windows easily
2. **Borrow checker**: Had to defer popout requests to avoid double-mutable borrows of World
3. **Render layers**: Careful management needed to avoid content appearing in wrong windows

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Resource-based requests**: Using a resource queue for window creation requests allows decoupling from the UI system
2. **Deferred processing**: Popout requests are collected and processed after UI state updates to avoid borrow conflicts
3. **Component tracking**: Each secondary window has a handle component for lifecycle management

## Recommendations

1. **Short term**: Focus on getting 3D viewport windows working well, as these provide immediate value
2. **Medium term**: Investigate bevy_egui alternatives or patches for proper multi-window UI support
3. **Long term**: Consider contributing multi-window support upstream to bevy_egui

## Usage

To use the multi-window feature:
1. Click the "⧉" button on any pane's tab
2. The pane will be removed from the main window and open in a new window
3. Close the secondary window to clean up resources (pane is not returned to main window yet)

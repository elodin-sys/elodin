three-body problem is a classic orbital dynamics situation.\nYou have three bodies, each with significant mass, all interacting gravitationally.\nThis turns out to be a chaotic system, with no general closed-form solution. There are however\na few stable configurations of the three-body problem.\nIn this tutorial, we will model one of the stable configurations from\nR. A. Broucke's technical report \"Period Orbits in the Restricted Three-Body Problem with Earth Moon Masses\".\nImport Elodin and JAX\nOur first step is to import Elodin and Jax into our environment:\n\nSIM_TIME_STEP value is the duration of each tick in the simulation.\nAdd 1st &amp; 2nd Body\nBefore we can do anything we'll need an instance of a World, and with that we can spawn our first entities:\n\nAdd a basic system\nLet's bring in the simplified earth gravity system we just used in the ball example:\n\nLet's try running the simulation\nBut first, let's add a view port so we can observe the world:\n\nNow, we're ready to start simulating:\n\nAt this point you should have a running simulation, with two bodies that simply fall just like the ball example.\nHowever we don't want a simulation of basic earth gravity, but instead we want the bodies to interact which\neach other gravitationally like planetary bodies, so let's update our system for that next.\nSetup Gravity Constraints\nThe gravitational force between two bodies is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n$$\nF_{ba}=-G\\frac{m_bm_a}{|r_{ba}|^3}{r}_{ba}\n$$\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Notice how we're using the Vector form of Newton's law,\ninstead of the more well known scalar form. This is\nbecause we're working in a 3D space. Sometimes you may have to convert between the two forms yourself.\n\n    \n\n\nLet's model this as a system that iterates over all gravity edges in a graph of connected bodies and calculates the forces between them.\nModeling with graphs and edges is a more advanced Elodin API, review the documentation for it here.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nAlso let's update the initial mass of our two bodies with the gravitational constant, this\nwill give them a mass more representative of a planetary body:\n\nGo ahead and run the simulation again, and you should see the two bodies interacting gravitationally.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        You'll want to make sure to always keep the six_dof() and w.run() calls at the end of your script.\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nAdd the Third Body\nWhat's a gravitational system without a third body? Let's add a third body to the system.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nIf you run the simulation now, you'll see the three bodies interacting gravitationally. However, you'll notice that the it's a bit unstable.\nA stable starting configuration\nThere are many known stable configurations for three-body systems, one of the most famous being the Lagrange points.\nFor our first attempt we'll reference the Brouke R 7 configuration, which is a stable configuration for three bodies of equal mass.\nGo ahead and update the starting values for our three bodies to the following:\n\nStart the simulation again, and you should see the three bodies in a stable configuration.\nAdd some gizmos\nSometimes it can be helpful to visualize the forces acting on the bodies and their movements in 3D space.

Align the board-to-board connector and gently press the boards together. The boards should be flush with each other.\nUse the provided screws to secure the boards together via the pre-mounted standoffs.\nPowering On\nBoth the carrier and expansion boards come with software pre-installed.\nDuring normal development, you'll use 2 USB-C cables: one to power the board, and the other to connect to your laptop:\n\nConnect \"USB-C Power\" to a 30W+ USB-PD power supply.\nEither:\n\nConnect \"USB-C w/ Serial\" to your laptop for serial console access.\nOR Connect \"USB-C w/ Ethernet\" to your laptop for an ethernet connection to the carrier board, allowing SSH access\n\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and connect your USB-C cables now.

This will demonstrate how to:\n\nSet up a basic physics simulation\nAdd multiple interacting systems\nBreak code into multiple files for better organization\n\nBasic Ball Simulation Setup\nAs a starting point, let's first setup a world with just a ball and gravity.\nImport Elodin and JAX\nFirst, let's import our required libraries:\n\nNotice we're importing typing and dataclasses, we'll use these later.\nCreate the World\nNow let's set up our simulation world:\n\nWe create a new elodin world, spawn an entity named \"Ball\" with a sphere mesh shape component, and a body archetype\nwhich provides the ball with a position, velocity, and other aspects related to the Elodin 6DoF system\n(see the 6DoF reference for more info).\nWe also spawn a viewport and a line to visualize the ball's position.\nDefine gravity\nLet's bring in our system for basic gravity:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Let's take a moment to understand the use of @el.map. This decorator creates an Elodin system from a function.\nThe inputs of the function acts a filter for which entities this applies to.  In this case, when the system is\nintegrated, the entities that have a Force and Inertia component will have this function applied to them. The function returns the\nupdated force, which is then used to update the velocity and position of the ball during integration in the system function below.\n\n    \n\nDefine the System\nLet's combine our systems into one complete simulation:\n\nRunning the Simulation\nWith everything set up, we can now run the simulation:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        The max_ticks parameter is used to limit the number of simulation steps. This is useful for debugging and testing. Notice how in this\ncase the simulation only runs for 10 seconds (1200 ticks at 120 ticks per second).\n\n    \n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nBouncing off the Ground\nYou'll notice that the ball falls beautifully, and right through the \"ground\" into infinity. Let's introduce\na system to handle bouncing off the ground instead:\n\nThe JAX syntax can be visually daunting at first; let's break this down:\nThe JAX lax.cond function is used to conditionally apply the bounce, if the position of the ball is below the ground.\nThe first argument is the condition, the second is the function to apply if the condition is true, and the third\nis the function to apply if the condition is false. The operand argument is not used in this case, so it's set to None.\nOur bounce is applied by reversing the velocity in the z-direction. We'll add \"bounciness\" later.\nUpdate the System\nWe now have two systems, gravity and bounce, that we want to apply to our simulation. We can combine them into a single system\nwith the concept of pipelining systems. Let's update our system function:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Notice we use a pipe | to combine the systems. This is a powerful concept in Elodin that allows you to chain systems together.\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        But why is gravity supplied to six_dof, while bounce is not? You'll notice bounce returns the resulting velocity, while gravity only\nsupplies forces that still need to be applied by an integrator. The six_dof system is an integrator that applies forces to update the\nvelocity and position of the ball. See the six_dof reference documentation\nfor more information.\n\n    \n\nWith bounce applied, let's try running it again:\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nLet's Make it Windy\nHaving a fully customizable ball bouncing physics simulation is great, but let's make it more interesting by adding some\nrandomized wind forces into the mix. We'll need to make a few changes to our simulation to accommodate this:\nCreate the Wind Component\nWe'll need a component to represent the wind force in our simulation:\n\nAdd Global Wind Data\nWe'll use a custom Archetype called \"WindData\" to maintain our random number generator seed and wind state:\n\nAlso make sure to update your world function to add a WindData instance:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        This is a simple technique to add global data into your simulation for easy reference.\n\n\n\n    \n\nWe'll need to set a value for the wind force in our WindData instance. We can do this by creating a system that generates\na random wind force vector and sets it in the Wind component of our WindData instance.\n\nThis system queries for Archetypes with Seed and Wind components, which will only be our\nsingle \"WindData\" Archetype entity, and then uses the value of the seed with the random key\nfunction to generate a random wind force vector to set for the Wind component.\nAdd the Wind Physics System\nNow we need a system to apply our wind force to objects. We could just naiively apply the force of the wind\nto our ball, but this wouldn't create a physically realistic simulation. Instead we can borrow from\nfluid dynamics and leverage the Simple Drag Equation:\n$$\nF_{d}=c_{d}r\\frac{v^2}{2}A\n$$\nThe drag equation states that drag force Fd is equal to the drag coefficient Cd times the density r\ntimes half of the velocity V squared times the reference area A\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Let's take a moment to understand @el.system, a lower level API for composing raw systems in Elodin:\n\nWhen this system is run, it will query for entities with the Wind component and entities with both Force and WorldVel components. These\nare provided as arrays of matching entities to the function body as w and q respectively. The function body is then expected to return a\nnew Query of Force component attached entities, which in this case the Query.map function provides. See\nQuery.map for more details.\n\n    \n\nUpdate the System Function\nFinally, we need to update our system function to include the wind and drag systems:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Notice we've made a distinction now of \"effectors\" as systems which return forces that will be integrated in the 6DoF model.\n\n    \n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nImproving the Wind Model\nYou'll notice that we're currently only considering the velocity of the fluid (wind) in the direction of the wind vector.\nThis is a simplification of the actual drag force due to wind that would be applied to the ball, because the ball's movement\nthrough the air also creates a movement of air fluid experienced by the ball.\n\n    \n    \n\nLet's update our apply_drag system to consider this additional aspect of air fluid movement:\n\nAnd voila! We now have a more accurate wind model that accounts for the drag force\non the ball as it moves through the air, notice how the ball now loses energy as it struggles against\nthe drag force along it's direction of movement.\nSpeaking of losing energy, there is one more thing we can do to improve the simulation: Add a coefficient of restitution\nto represent the \"bounciness\" of the ball. This will allow us to model the ball losing energy on each bounce.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nThis bounce system uses a coefficient of restitution of 0.85,\nmeaning the ball will lose 15% of its energy on each bounce.\nMake it Windy, Simpler\nCrafting a simulation in Elodin allows for approaching a problem in multiple ways. We can simplify our wind simulation\nby considering the wind not as a global constant, but instead as a force that affects the ball directly, as experienced from the perspective\nof the ball entity. This will allow us to use the same apply_drag system, but using the @el.map decorator instead of @el.system,\nallowing for a simpler implementation.\nUpdate the Ball Entity\nFirst remove the global spawn of WindData and instead add a WindData component to the ball entity:\n\nConvert use of @el.System\nYou can now convert the sample_wind system to use the simpler @el.map decorator:\n\nAnd likewise the apply_drag system can be simplified to directly query the wind component from the ball entity,\nresulting in much simpler syntax and conceptual model:\n\nYou should be able to run the simulation and see the same behavior as before, but with a simpler implementation.\nChecking your work\nSuccess! We've added a wind force to our simulation. The ball now bounces around the world with the wind\naffecting its trajectory, steadily blowing the ball in a single direction, losing energy as it bounces.\nIf you'd like to check your work, you can compare to the example at examples/ball/.\n\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/bouncing-ball/","title":"Bouncing Ball"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/db/architecture/":{"body":"Elodin DB is built around the same entity-component concepts that Elodin Sim and Impeller use. In essence entities represent logical \"objects\" in the system -- think sensors, actuators, spacecraft. Components represent individual pieces of telemetry - think a sensor reading, an attitude estimate, an actuator commanded position, etc.\nData Model\nThe core primitive of Elodin DB is the tensor, or the n-dimensional array. A scalar is a 0 dimensional tensor, a vector is a 1 dimensional tensor, a matrix is a 2 dimensional tensor, and so on. Tensors in Elodin DB have a dimension, a primitive type (f64, f32, etc), and their associated data. Tensors are fixed size and dense (non-sparse).\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        We are using tensor in the ML framework / programming sense, not the pure mathematical sense.\n\n    \n\nElodin DB stores tensors in time-series columns associated with a particular entity-component pair. Conceptually each entity-component pair is a table with each row being a timestamp, and a tensor. Timestamps are stored as i64 microsecond offsets from Unix epoch.\nTimeData\n1742223919e6[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n1742223919[4.0, 5.0, 6.0]\n\nVTable\nElodin DB uses a dynamic data-extraction system for fast data-ingest. Instead of requiring that data is sent in a fixed format - Elodin DB allows users to generate a vtable that describes the data being ingested. Loosely this can be thought of as a collection of offsets combined with entity and component ids. We borrowed the concept of a vtable from FlatBuffers, which use them in a similar manner.\nOne of the powers of VTables is that it lets us send raw structs over the wire, without serializing them. For instance take this struct:\n\nThis struct contains a number of fields each associated with a different component. We can send Elodin DB this struct, unchanged, by formulating a VTable like below.\n\nIn this example we are using a Lua script with the VTableBuilder API. Each time we call column it increments the internal offset by the size of the tensor. So the final VTable looks like this\nOffsetComponent IDTypeShapeEntity IDs\n0tsu32[][1]\n4magf32[3][1]\n16gyrof32[3][1]\n28accelf32[3][1]\n40mag_tempf32[][1]\n44mag_sampleu32[][1]\n48barof32[][1]\n52baro_tempf32[][1]\n\nMessages\nUp until now we've discussed how to store telemetry that best fits into a time series of fixed-size tensors. Sometimes our data doesn't fit cleanly into the concept of \"telemetry\" and fixed sized structures. What if we want to send a single message that contains a variable length sequence of commands? What if we want to send compressed data that is variable length? What if we want to signal a state transition using an enum?\nFor these cases, Elodin DB supports messages which are variable length, postcard encoded. This allows you to pack virtually any data structure that postcard can represent.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Technically, you can store any variable length data in a message, but for all of Elodin DB's features to work postcard is the best choice.\n\n    \n\nMessages are stored in a table made up of three-columns: a timestamp, an \"offset\" column, and a \"data\" column. The offset column is encoded using the Umbra string format (also called German Strings). Instead of just storing a length and offset to the data - an Umbra string optionally stores the data inline with the length. This allows for fast path lookups up data less than 12 bytes. Our implementation of this table is designed to be compatible with the Arrow \"Variable-size Binary View Layout\".\nOn Disk Layout\nElodin DB uses a collection of memory mapped files to store data. Each separate column in a table maps to a different memory mapped file in its own directory. The files are not meant to be human readable. The directory structure is documented here for information purposes only.\n\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/db/architecture/","title":"Architecture"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/db/overview/":{"body":"Elodin DB is a time-series database purpose built for flight computers.

Elodin DB sorts data into \"entities\" and \"components\". Entities are best thought as objects that emit telemetry. For instance an individual sensor would be an entity.

Model rockets vary greatly in size, shape, weight, and construction from detailed scale models of professional rockets to lightweight and highly finished competition models. The sport is relatively popular and is often cited as a source of inspiration for children to become engineers and scientists.\nThe hobby started as amateur rocketry in the 1950s when hobbyists wanted to experiment with building rockets. Designing, building, and firing self-made motors was, however, extremely dangerous, and the American Rocket Society (now the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, AIAA) has estimated that about one in seven amateur rocketeers during the time were injured in their hobby. This changed in 1958 when the first commercially-built model rocket motors became available. Having industrially-made, reasonably-priced, and safe motors available removed the most dangerous aspect of amateur rocketry. This, along with strict guidelines to the design and launching of model rockets, formed the foundation for a safe and widespread hobby. [2, pp. 1–3]\nSince then, model rocketry has spread around the globe and among all age groups. Thousands of rockets ranging from 10 cm high miniatures to large models reaching altitudes in excess of 10 km are launched annually. Model rocket motors with thrusts from a few Newtons up to several kilo-Newtons are readily available. Since its forming in 1957, over 90,000 people have joined the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) in the U.S. alone.\nIn designing rockets, the stability of a rocket is of central priority. A stable rocket corrects its course if some outside force disturbs it slightly. A disturbance of an unstable rocket instead increases until the rocket starts spinning in the air erratically. As shall be discussed in Section 2.4, a rocket is deemed statically stable if its center of pressure (CP) is aft of its center of gravity (CG)1. The center of gravity of a rocket can be easily calculated in advance or determined experimentally. The center of pressure, on the other hand, has been quite hard to determine either analytically or experimentally. In 1966 James and Judith Barrowman developed an analytical method for determining the CP of a slender-bodied rocket at subsonic speeds and presented their results as a research and development project at the 8th National Association of Rocketry Annual Meeting (NARAM-8) [3], and later as a part of James Barrowman’s Master’s thesis [4]. This method has become known as the Barrowman method of determining the CP of a rocket within the model rocketry community, and has a major role in determining the aerodynamic characteristics of model rockets.\nAnother important aerodynamic quantity of interest is the aerodynamic drag of a rocket. Drag is caused by the flow of air around the rocket and it can easily reduce the maximum altitude of a rocket by 50–80% of the otherwise theoretical maximum. Estimating the drag of a model rocket is a rather complex task, and the effects of different design choices are not always very evident to a hobbyist.\nKnowing the fundamental aerodynamic properties of a rocket allows one to simulate its free flight. This involves numerically integrating the flight forces and determining the velocity, rotation, and position of the rocket as a function of time. This is best performed by software designed for the purpose of model rocket design.\nRockSim [5] is one such piece of software. It is a commercial, proprietary program that allows one to define the geometry and configuration of a model rocket, estimate its aerodynamic properties, and simulate a launch with different rocket motors. It has become the de facto standard software for model rocket performance estimation. However, as a proprietary program, it is essentially a “black-box” solution. Someone wishing to study or validate the methods will not be able to do so. Similarly extending or customizing the functionality or refining the calculations methods to fit one's needs is impossible. The software is also only available on select operating systems. Finally, the cost of the software may be prohibitive, especially for younger hobbyists, voluntary organizations, clubs, and schools.\nOpen Source software, on the other hand, has become an increasingly competitive alternative to proprietary software. Open Source allows free access to the source code of the programs and encourages users with the know-how to enhance the software and share their changes [6]. Success stories such as the Linux operating system, the OpenOffice.org office suite, the Firefox web browser, and countless others have shown that Open Source software can often achieve and even exceed the quality of expensive proprietary software.\n\n1\nAn alternative term would be center of mass, but in the context of model rocketry, we are interested in the effect of gravity on the rocket. Thus, the term center of gravity is widely used in model rocketry texts, and this convention will be followed in this thesis.\n\n\n1.1 Objectives of the Thesis\nThe objectives of this thesis work are to:\n\n\nDevelop and document relatively easy, yet reasonably accurate methods for the calculation of the fundamental aerodynamic properties of model rockets and their numerical simulation;\n\n\nTest the methods developed and compare the results with other estimates and actual experimental data; and\n\n\nImplement a cross-platform, Open Source model rocket design and simulation software that uses the aforementioned methods, is at the same time easy to use and yet versatile, and which is easily extensible and customizable for user requirements, new types of rocket components and new estimation methods.\n\n\nThe methods presented will largely follow the methods developed by Barrowman [3, 4], since these are already familiar to the rocketry community. Several extensions to the methods will be added to allow for more accurate calculation at larger angles of attack and for fin shapes not accounted for in the original paper. The emphasis will be on subsonic flight, but extensions will be made for reasonable estimation at transonic and low supersonic velocities.\nThe software developed as part of the thesis is the OpenRocket project [7]. It is an Open Source rocket development and simulation environment written totally in Java. The program structure has been designed to make full use of object-oriented programming, allowing one to easily extend its features. The software also includes a framework for creating user-made listener components (discussed in Section 5.1.3) that can listen to and interact with the simulation while it is running. This allows a powerful and easy way of interacting with the simulation and allows simulating, for example, guidance systems.\nOne possible future enhancement that has also specifically been considered throughout the development is calculating the aerodynamic properties using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD calculates the exact airflow in a discretized mesh around the rocket. This would allow for even more accurate calculation of the aerodynamic forces for odd-shaped rockets, for which the methods explained herein do not fully apply.\nIt is anticipated that the software will allow more hobbyists the possibility of simulating their rocket designs prior to building them and experimenting with different configurations, thus giving them a deeper understanding of the aerodynamics of rocket flight. It will also provide a more versatile educational tool since the simulation methods are open and everyone will be able to “look under the hood” and see how the software performs the calculations.\nIn Chapter 2, a brief overview of model rocketry and its different aspects will be given. Then in Chapter 3, methods for calculating the aerodynamic properties of a general model rocket will be presented. In Chapter 4, the aspects of simulating a rocket’s flight are considered. Chapter 5 then explains how the aerodynamic calculations and simulation are implemented in the OpenRocket software and presents some of its features. In Chapter 6, the results of the software simulation are compared with the performance of constructed and launched rockets. Chapter 7 then presents a summary of the achievements and identifies areas of further work.\n\nChapter 2\nBasics of Model Rocket Flight\nAs rockets and rocket motors come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, different categories are defined for different levels of rocketry. Model rocketry itself is governed by the NAR Model Rocket Safety Code [8] in the U.S. and other similar regulations in other countries. The safety code requires that the model rockets be constructed only of lightweight materials without any metal structural parts and have a maximum lift-off weight of 1.5 kg. They may only use pre-manufactured motors of classes A–G (see Section 2.2 for the classification).\nHigh power rocketry (HPR) is basically scaled-up model rocketry. There are no weight restrictions, and they can use pre-manufactured solid or hybrid rocket motors in the range of H–O. The combined total impulse of all motors may not exceed 81,920 Ns.\nExperimental or amateur rocketry includes any rocketry activities beyond model and high power rocketry. This may include, for example, using motor combinations that exceed the limits placed by high power rocketry, building self-made motors, or utilizing liquid fueled motors. Finally, there is professional rocketry, which is conducted for profit, usually by governments or large corporations.\nEven though rockets come in many different sizes, the same principles apply to all of them. In this thesis, the emphasis will be on model rocketry, but the results are just as valid for larger rockets as long as the assumptions of, for example, the speed range remain valid. In this chapter, the basics of model rocket flight are discussed.\n\n2.1 Model Rocket Flight\nA typical flight of a model rocket can be characterized by the four phases depicted in Figure 2.1:\n\nLaunch: The model rocket is launched from a vertical launch guide.\nPowered flight: The motor accelerates the rocket during the powered flight period.\nCoasting flight: The rocket coasts freely until approximately at its apogee.\nRecovery: The recovery device opens and the rocket descends slowly to the ground.\n\nModel rockets are launched from a vertical launch guide that keeps the rocket in an upright position until it has sufficient velocity for the fins to aerodynamically stabilize the flight. The NAR safety code forbids launching a model rocket at an angle greater than 30° from vertical. A typical launch guide for small rockets is a metal rod about 3–5 mm in diameter, and the launch lug is a short piece of plastic tube glued to the body tube. Especially in larger rockets this may be replaced by two extruding bolts, the ends of which slide along a metal rail. Use of a launch lug can be avoided by a tower launcher, which has 3–4 metal bars around the rocket that hold it in an upright position.\nAfter clearing the launch guide, the rocket is in free, powered flight. During this phase the motor accelerates the rocket while it is aerodynamically stabilized to keep its vertical orientation. When the propellant has been used, the rocket is typically at its maximum velocity. It then coasts freely for a short period while the motor produces smoke to help follow the rocket, but provides no additional thrust. Finally, at approximately the point of apogee, a small pyrotechnical ejection charge is fired upwards from the motor which pressurizes the model rocket and opens the recovery device.\nHigh-power rocket motors usually have no ejection charges incorporated in them. Instead, the rocket carries a small flight computer that measures the acceleration and handles the recovery process.\n\nFigure 2.1: The basic phases of a typical model rocket flight:\n\nLaunch,\nPowered flight,\nCoasting, and\nRecovery.\n\nAcceleration of the rocket or the outside pressure change is used to detect the point of apogee and to open the recovery device. Frequently, only a small drogue parachute is opened at apogee, and the main parachute is opened at some pre-defined lower altitude around 100–300 meters.\nThe typical recovery device of a model rocket is either a parachute or a streamer. The parachutes are usually a simple planar circle of plastic or fabric with 4–10 shroud lines attached. A streamer is a strip of plastic or fabric connected to the rocket, intended to flutter in the air and thus slow down the descent of the rocket. Especially small rockets often use streamers as their recovery device, since even light wind can cause a lightweight rocket with a parachute to drift a significant distance.\n2.2 Rocket Motor Classification\nThe motors used in model and high power rocketry are categorized based on their total impulse. A class ‘A’ motor may have a total impulse in the range of...\nTable 2.1: Total impulse ranges for motor classes $\\frac{1}{4}$A–O.\nClassImpulse Range (Ns)ClassImpulse Range (Ns)\n$\\frac{1}{4}$A0.0–0.625H160.01–320\n$\\frac{1}{2}$A0.626–1.25I320.01–640\nA1.26–2.50J640.01–1280\nB2.51–5.00K1280.01–2560\nC5.01–10.0L2560.01–5120\nD10.01–20.0M5120.01–10240\nE20.01–40.0N10240.01–20480\nF40.01–80.0O20480.01–40960\nG80.01–160P40960.01–81920\n\nEvery consecutive class doubles the allowed total impulse of the motor. Thus, a B-motor can have an impulse in the range 2.51–5.00 Ns and a C-motor in the range 5.01–10.0 Ns. There are also classes $\\frac{1}{2}$A and $\\frac{1}{4}$A which have impulse ranges half and one quarter of those of an A-motor, respectively. Commercial rocket motors are available up to class O with a total impulse of 30,000 Ns [9]. Table 2.1 lists the impulse ranges for model and high-power rocket motors.\nAnother important parameter of a rocket motor is the thrust given by the motor. This defines the mass that may be lifted by the motor and the acceleration achieved. Small model rocket motors typically have an average thrust of about 3–10 N, while high-power rocket motors can have thrusts in excess of 5,000 N.\nThe third parameter used to classify a model rocket motor is the length of the delay between the motor burnout and the ignition of the ejection charge. Since the maximum velocity of different rockets using the same type of motor can be vastly different, also the length of the coasting phase varies. Therefore, motors with otherwise the same specifications are often manufactured with several different delay lengths. These delay lengths do not apply to high-power rocket motors, since they do not have ejections charges incorporated in them.\nModel rocket motors are given a classification code based on these three parameters, for example “D7-3”. The letter specifies the total impulse range of the motor, while the first number specifies the average thrust in Newtons and the second number the delay of the ejection charge in seconds. The delay number can also be replaced by ‘P’, which stands for plugged, i.e., the motor does not have an ejection charge. Some manufacturers may also use an additional letter at the end of the classification code specifying the propellant type.\n\nFigure 2.2: A typical thrust curve of an Estes D12-3 rocket motor and its average thrust [11].\nType used in the motor.\nEven motors with the same classification code may have slight variations to them. First, the classification only specifies the impulse range of the motor, not the exact impulse. In principle, a D-motor in the lower end of the range might have a total impulse only 1 Ns larger than a C-motor in the upper end of its range. Second, the code only specifies the average thrust of the motor. The thrust rarely is constant, but varies with time. Figure 2.2 shows the typical thrust curve of a small black powder rocket motor. The motors typically have a short thrust peak at ignition that gives the rocket an initial acceleration boost before stabilizing to a thrust level a little below the average thrust. Statically measured thrust curves of most commercial rocket motors are readily available on the Internet [10].\nAlso, the propellant type may affect the characteristics of the motor. Most model rocket motors are made up of a solid, pyrotechnical propellant—typically black powder—that is cast into a suitable shape and ignited on launch. Since the propellant burns on its surface, different thrust curves can be achieved by different mold shapes.\nA significantly different motor type, hybrid motors, were commercially introduced in 1995. These motors typically include the propellant and oxidizer in separate compartments, allowing for more control over the burning process.\nIn different states, typically a composite plastic as the fuel and a separate tank of liquid nitrous oxide (N₂O) as the oxidizer. The plastic on its own does not burn very well, but provides ample thrust when the nitrous oxide is fed through its core. The nitrous oxide tank is self-pressurized by its natural vapor pressure. However, since temperature greatly affects the vapor pressure of nitrous oxide, the thrust of a hybrid motor is also diminished if the oxidizer is cold. On the other hand, the motor will burn longer in this case, and since nitrous oxide is denser when cold, the motor may even yield a greater total impulse.\nThe significance of this effect was observed when analyzing the video footage of the launch of the first Finnish hybrid rocket, “Haisunäättä” [12]. The average thrust during the first 0.5 seconds was determined to be only about 70 N, whereas the static tests suggest the thrust should have been over 200 N. Instead, the motor burned for over 10 seconds, while the normal thrust curves indicate a burning time of 5–6 seconds. This shows that the temperature of the hybrid motor oxidizer can have a dramatic effect on the thrust given by the motor, and the static test curve should be assumed to be valid only in similar operating conditions as during the test.\nOne further non-pyrotechnical rocket type is water rockets. These are especially popular first rockets, as they require no special permits and are easy to construct. The water rocket includes a bottle or other chamber that has water and pressurized air inside it. On launch the pressure forces the water out of a nozzle, providing thrust to the rocket. While simulating water rockets is beyond the scope of this thesis, it is the aim that methods for modeling water rockets can be added to the produced software in the future.\n2.3 Clustering and Staging\nTwo common methods used to achieve greater altitudes with model rockets are clustering and staging. A cluster has two or more rocket motors burning concurrently, while staging uses motors that burn consecutively. The motor configuration of a cluster and staged rocket is depicted in Figure 2.3.\nWhen a cluster is launched, the total thrust is the sum of the thrust curves of the separate motors. This allows greater acceleration and a greater liftoff weight. Staging is usually performed by using zero-delay motors, that ignite immediately as the lower stage burns out, ensuring continuous thrust and achieving higher altitudes.\n\nFigure 2.3: The motor configuration for (a) a cluster rocket and (b) a two-staged rocket.\nThe ejection charge immediately at burnout. The ejection charge fires towards the upper stage motor and ignites the next motor. High power motors with no ejection charges can be clustered by using an onboard accelerometer or timer that ignites the subsequent stages. Staging provides a longer duration of powered flight, thus increasing the altitude.\nClustering provides greater acceleration at launch, but staging typically provides greater altitude than a cluster with similar motors. This is because a clustered rocket accelerates quickly to greater speeds thus also increasing aerodynamic drag. A staged rocket has a smaller thrust for a longer period of time, which reduces the overall effect of drag during the flight.\n2.4 Stability of a Rocket\nWhen designing a new rocket, its stability is of paramount importance. A small gust of wind or some other disturbance may cause the rocket to tilt slightly from its current orientation. When this occurs, the rocket centerline is no longer parallel to the velocity of the rocket. This condition is called flying at an angle of attack $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle between the rocket centerline and the velocity vector.\nWhen a stable rocket flies at an angle of attack, its fins produce a moment to correct the rocket’s flight. The corrective moment is produced by the aerodynamic forces perpendicular to the axis of the rocket. Each component\n\nFigure 2.4: Normal forces produced by the rocket components.\nEach component of the rocket can be seen as producing a separate normal force component originating from the component's center of pressure (CP), as depicted in Figure 2.4.\nThe effect of the separate normal forces can be combined into a single force, the magnitude of which is the sum of the separate forces and which effects the same moment as the separate forces. The point on which the total force acts is defined as the center of pressure of the rocket. As can be seen from Figure 2.4, the moment produced attempts to correct the rocket's flight only if the CP is located aft of the center of gravity (CG). If this condition holds, the rocket is said to be statically stable. A statically stable rocket always produces a corrective moment when flying at a small angle of attack.\nThe argument for static stability above may fail in two conditions: First, the normal forces might cancel each other out exactly, in which case a moment would be produced but with zero total force. Second, the normal force at the CP might be in the wrong direction (downward in the figure), yielding an uncorrective moment. However, we shall see that the only component to produce a downward force is a boat tail, and the force is equivalent to the corresponding broadening of the body. Therefore the total force acting on the rocket cannot be zero nor in a direction to produce an uncorrective moment when aft of the CG.\nThe stability margin of a rocket is defined as the distance between the CP and CG, measured in calibers, where one caliber is the maximum body diameter of the rocket. A rule of thumb among model rocketeers is that the CP should be approximately 1–2 calibers aft of the CG. However, the CP of a rocket typically moves upwards as the angle of attack increases. In some cases, a 1–2 caliber stability margin may totally disappear at an angle of attack of only a few degrees. As side wind is the primary cause of angles of attack, this effect is called wind caused instability [13].\nAnother stability issue concerning rocketeers is the dynamic stability of a rocket. A rocket that is statically stable may still be poor at returning the rocket to the original orientation quickly enough. Model rockets may encounter several types of dynamic instability depending on their shape, size and mass [2, pp. 140–141]:\n\n\nToo little oscillation damping. In short, lightweight rockets the corrective moment may significantly over-correct the perturbation, requiring a corrective moment in the opposite direction. This may lead to continuous oscillation during the flight.\n\n\nToo small corrective moment. This is the case of over-damped oscillation, where the corrective moment is too small compared to the moment of inertia of the rocket. Before the rocket has been able to correct its orientation, the thrust of the motors may have already significantly affected the direction of flight.\n\n\nRoll-pitch coupling. If the model has a natural roll frequency (caused e.g. by canting the fins) close to the oscillation frequency of the rocket, roll-pitch resonance may occur and cause the model to go unstable.\n\n\nBy definition, dynamic stability issues are such that they occur over time during the flight of the rocket. A full flight simulation that takes into account all corrective moments automatically also simulates the possible dynamic stability problems. Therefore, the dynamic stability of rockets will not be further considered in this thesis. For an analytical consideration of the problem, refer to [14].\n\nChapter 3\nAerodynamic Properties of Model Rockets\nA model rocket encounters three basic forces during its flight: thrust from the motors, gravity, and aerodynamical forces. Thrust is generated by the motors by exhausting high-velocity gases in the opposite direction. The thrust of a motor is directly proportional to the velocity of the escaping gas and the mass per time unit that is exhausted. The thrust of commercial model rocket motors as a function of time have been measured in static motor tests and are readily available online [10]. Normally the thrust of a rocket motor is aligned on the center axis of the rocket, so that it produces no angular moment to the rocket.\nEvery component of the rocket is also affected by gravitational force. When the forces and moments generated are summed up, the gravitational force can be seen as a single force originating from the center of gravity (CG). A homogeneous gravitational field does not generate any angular moment on a body relative to the CG. Calculating the gravitational force is therefore a simple matter of determining the total mass and CG of the rocket.\nAerodynamic forces, on the other hand, produce both net forces and angular moments. To determine the effect of the aerodynamic forces on the rocket, the total force and moment must be calculated relative to some reference point. In this chapter, a method for determining these forces and moments will be presented.\n\nFigure 3.1: (a) Forces acting on a rocket in free flight: gravity $G$, motor thrust $T$, drag $D$, and normal force $N$. (b) Perpendicular component pairs of the total aerodynamical force: normal force $N$ and axial drag $D_A$; side force $S$ and drag $D$. (c) The pitch, yaw, and roll directions of a model rocket.\n3.1 General Aerodynamical Properties\nThe aerodynamic forces acting on a rocket are usually split into components for further examination. The two most important aerodynamic force components of interest in a typical model rocket are the normal force and drag. The aerodynamical normal force is the force component that generates the corrective moment around the CG and provides stabilization of the rocket. The drag of a rocket is defined as the force component parallel to the velocity of the rocket. This is the aerodynamical force that opposes the movement of the rocket through air.\nFigure 3.1(a) shows the thrust, gravity, normal force, and drag of a rocket in free flight. It should be noted that if the rocket is flying at an angle of attack $\\alpha &gt; 0$, then the normal force and drag are not perpendicular. In order to have independent force components, it is necessary to define component pairs that are always perpendicular to one another. Two such pairs are the normal force and axial drag, or side force and drag, shown in Figure 3.1(b). The two pairs coincide if the angle of attack is zero. The component pair that will be used as a basis for the flight simulations is the normal force and axial drag.\nThe three moments around the different axes are called the pitch, yaw, and roll moments, as depicted in Figure 3.1(c). Since a typical rocket has no \"natural\" roll angle of flight as an aircraft does, we may choose the pitch angle to be in the same plane as the angle of attack, i.e., the plane defined by the velocity vector and the centerline of the rocket. Thus, the normal force generates the pitching moment and no other moments.\n3.1.1 Aerodynamic Force Coefficients\nWhen studying rocket configurations, the absolute force values are often difficult to interpret, since many factors affect them. In order to get a value better suited for comparison, the forces are normalized by the current dynamic pressure $ q = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 $ and some characteristic area $ A_{\\text{ref}} $ to get a non-dimensional force coefficient. Similarly, the moments are normalized by the dynamic pressure, characteristic area, and characteristic length $ d $. Thus, the normal force coefficient corresponding to the normal force $ N $ is defined as\n$$\nC_N = \\frac{N}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}}}\n$$\nand the pitch moment coefficient for a pitch moment $ m $ as\n$$\nC_m = \\frac{m}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}} d}.\n$$\nA typical choice of reference area is the base of the rocket’s nose cone, and the reference length is its diameter.\nThe pitch moment is always calculated around some reference point, while the normal force stays constant regardless of the point of origin. If the moment coefficient $ C_m $ is known for some reference point, the moment coefficient at another point $ C_m' $ can be calculated from\n$$\nC_m' d = C_m d - C_N \\Delta x\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta x$ is the distance along the rocket centerline. Therefore, it is sufficient to calculate the moment coefficient only at some constant point along the rocket body. In this thesis, the reference point is chosen to be the tip of the nose cone.\nThe center of pressure (CP) is defined as the position from which the total normal force alone produces the current pitching moment. Therefore, the total.\nThe normal force produces no moment around the CP itself, and an equation for the location of the CP can be obtained from (3.3) by setting $C_m' = 0$:\n$$\nX = \\frac{C_m}{C_N} d\n$$\nHere $X$ is the position of the CP along the rocket centerline from the nose cone tip. This equation is valid when $\\alpha &gt; 0$. As $\\alpha$ approaches zero, both $C_m$ and $C_N$ approach zero. The CP is then obtained as a continuous extension using l’Hôpital’s rule:\n$$\nX = \\left. \\frac{\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha}}{\\frac{\\partial C_N}{\\partial \\alpha}} d \\right|_{\\alpha=0}\n$$\n$$\nX = \\frac{C_m}{C_N} d\n$$\nwhere the normal force coefficient and pitch moment coefficient derivatives have been defined as\n$$\nC_{N_\\alpha} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial C_N}{\\partial \\alpha} \\right|_{\\alpha=0}\n$$\n$$\nC_{m_\\alpha} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial \\alpha} \\right|_{\\alpha=0}.\n$$\nAt very small angles of attack we may approximate $C_N$ and $C_m$ to be linear with $\\alpha$, so to a first approximation\n$$\nC_N \\approx C_{N_\\alpha} \\alpha \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_m \\approx C_{m_\\alpha} \\alpha.\n$$\nThe Barrowman method uses the coefficient derivatives to determine the CP position using equation (3.5). However, there are some significant nonlinearities in the variation of $C_N$ as a function of $\\alpha$. These will be accounted for by holding the approximation of equation (3.7) exact and letting $C_{N_\\alpha}$ and $C_{m_\\alpha}$ be a function of $\\alpha$. Therefore, for the purposes of this thesis we define\n$$\nC_{N_\\alpha} = \\frac{C_N}{\\alpha} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_{m_\\alpha} = \\frac{C_m}{\\alpha}\n$$\nfor $\\alpha &gt; 0$ and by equation (3.6) for $\\alpha = 0$. These definitions are compatible, since equation (3.8) simplifies to the partial derivative (3.6) at the limit $\\alpha \\to 0$. This definition also allows us to stay true to Barrowman’s original method which is familiar to many rocketeers.\nSimilar to the normal force coefficient, the drag coefficient is defined as\n$$\nC_D = \\frac{D}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}}}.\n$$\nSince the size of the rocket has been factored out, the drag coefficient at zero angle of attack $C_{D0}$ allows a straightforward method of comparing the effect of different rocket shapes on drag. However, this coefficient is not constant and will vary with, e.g., the speed of the rocket and its angle of attack.\nIf each of the fins of a rocket are canted at some angle $\\delta &gt; 0$ with respect to the rocket centerline, the fins will produce a roll moment on the rocket. Contrary to the normal force and pitching moment, canting the fins will produce a non-zero rolling moment but no corresponding net force. Therefore, the only quantity computed is the roll moment coefficient, defined by\n$$\nC_l = \\frac{l}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}} d}\n$$\nwhere $l$ is the roll moment.\nIt shall be shown later that rockets with axially-symmetrical fin configurations experience no forces that would produce net yawing moments. However, a single fin may produce all six types of forces and moments. The equations for the forces and moments of a single fin will not be explicitly written out, and they can be computed from the geometry in question.\n3.1.2 Velocity Regions\nMost of the aerodynamic properties of rockets vary with the velocity of the rocket. The important parameter is the Mach number, which is the free-stream velocity of the rocket divided by the local speed of sound\n$$\nM = \\frac{v_0}{c}.\n$$\nThe velocity range encountered by rockets is divided into regions with different impacts on the aerodynamical properties, listed in Table 3.1.\nIn subsonic flight all of the airflow around the rocket occurs below the speed of sound. This is the case for approximately $M &lt; 0.8$. At very low Mach numbers air can be effectively treated as an incompressible fluid, but already above $M \\approx 0.3$ some compressibility issues may have to be considered.\nTable 3.1: Velocity regions of rocket flight\nRegionMach Number ($M$)\nSubsonic0 – 0.8\nTransonic0.8 – 1.2\nSupersonic1.2 – ∼ 5\nHypersonic∼ 5 –\n\nIn transonic flight some of the air flowing around the rocket accelerates above the speed of sound, while at other places it remains subsonic. Some local shock waves are generated and hard-to-predict interference effects may occur. The drag of a rocket has a sharp increase in the transonic region, making it hard to pass into the supersonic region. Transonic flight occurs at Mach numbers of approximately 0.8–1.2.\nIn supersonic flight all of the airflow is faster than the speed of sound (with the exception of, e.g., the nose cone tip). A shock wave is generated by the nose cone and fins. In supersonic flight, the drag reduces from that of transonic flight, but is generally greater than that of subsonic flight. Above approximately Mach 5 new phenomena begin to emerge that are not encountered at lower supersonic speeds. This region is called hypersonic flight.\nMethods for predicting the aerodynamic properties of subsonic flight and some extensions to supersonic flight will be presented. Since the analytical prediction of aerodynamic properties in the transonic region is quite difficult, this region will be accounted for by using some suitable interpolation function that corresponds reasonably to actual measurements. Hypersonic flight will not be considered, since practically no model or high power rockets ever achieve such speeds.\n3.1.3 Flow and Geometry Parameters\nThere exist many different parameters that characterize aspects of flow or a rocket’s geometry. One of the most important flow parameters is the Reynolds number $R$. It is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the ratio of inertial forces and viscous forces of flow. Many aerodynamic properties depend on the Reynolds number, defined as\n$$\nR = \\frac{v_0 L}{\\nu}.\n$$\nHere $v_0$ is the free-stream velocity of the rocket, $L$ is a characteristic length and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of air. It is notable that the Reynolds number is dependent on a characteristic length of the object in question. In most cases, the length used is the length of the rocket. A typical 30 cm sport model flying at 50 m/s has a corresponding Reynolds number of approximately 1,000,000.\nAnother term that is frequently encountered in aerodynamical equations has been defined its own parameter $\\beta$, which characterizes the flow speed both in subsonic and supersonic flow:\n$$\n\\beta = \\sqrt{|M^2 - 1|} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\sqrt{1 - M^2}, &amp; \\text{if } M &lt; 1 \\newline \\\n\\sqrt{M^2 - 1}, &amp; \\text{if } M &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAs the flow speed approaches the transonic region, $\\beta$ approaches zero. This term appears, for example, in the Prandtl factor $P$ which corrects subsonic force coefficients for compressible flow:\n$$\nP = \\frac{1}{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - M^2}}\n$$\nIt is also often useful to define parameters characterizing general properties of a rocket. One such parameter is the caliber, defined as the maximum body diameter. The caliber is often used to indicate relative distances on the body of a rocket, such as the stability margin. Another common parameter characterizes the “slenderness” of a rocket. It is the fineness ratio of a rocket $f_B$, defined as the length of the rocket body divided by the maximum body diameter. Typical model rockets have a fineness ratio in the range of 10–20, but extreme models may have a fineness ratio as low as 5 or as large as 50.\n3.1.4 Coordinate Systems\nDuring calculation of the aerodynamic properties, a coordinate system fixed to the rocket will be used. The origin of the coordinates is at the nose cone tip with the positive x-axis directed along the rocket centerline. This convention is also followed internally in the produced software. In the following sections the position of the y- and z-axes are arbitrary; the parameter $y$ is used as a general spanwise coordinate when discussing the fins. During simulation, however, the y- and z-axes are fixed in relation to the rocket, and do not necessarily align with the plane of the pitching moments.\n3.2 Normal Forces and Pitching Moments\nBarrowman's method [4] for determining the total normal force coefficient derivative $C_{N_\\alpha}$, the pitch moment coefficient derivative $C_{m_\\alpha}$, and the CP location at subsonic speeds first splits the rocket into simple separate components, then calculates the CP location and $C_{N_\\alpha}$ for each component separately and then combines these to get the desired coefficients and CP location. The general assumptions made by the derivation are:\n\nThe angle of attack is very close to zero.\nThe flow around the body is steady and non-rotational.\nThe rocket is a rigid body.\nThe nose tip is a sharp point.\nThe fins are flat plates.\nThe rocket body is axially symmetric.\n\nThe components that will be discussed are nose cones, cylindrical body tube sections, shoulders, boattails and fins, in an arbitrary order. The interference effect between the body and fins will be taken into account by a separate correction term. Extensions to account for body lift and arbitrary fin shapes will also be derived.\n3.2.1 Axially Symmetric Body Components\nThe body of the rocket is assumed to be an axially symmetric body of rotation. The entire body could be considered to be a single component, but in practice it is divided into nose cones, shoulders, boattails and cylindrical body tube sections. The geometry of typical nose cones, shoulders and boattails are described in Appendix A.\nThe method presented by Barrowman for calculating the normal force and pitch moment coefficients at supersonic speeds is based on a second-order shock expansion method. However, this assumes that the body of the rocket is very streamlined, and it cannot handle areas with a slope larger than about $30^\\circ$. Since the software allows basically any body shape, applying this method would be difficult.\nSince the emphasis is on subsonic flow, for the purposes of this thesis the normal force and pitching moments produced by the body are assumed to be equal at subsonic and supersonic speeds. The assumption is that the CP location is primarily affected by the fins. The effect of supersonic flight on the drag of the body will be accounted for in Section 3.4.\n$ C_{N_\\alpha} $ of Body Components at Subsonic Speeds\nThe normal force for an axially symmetric body at position $x$ in subsonic flow is given by\n$$\nN(x) = \\rho v_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ A(x) w(x) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $A(x)$ is the cross-sectional area of the body, and the $w(x)$ is the local downwash, given as a function of the angle of attack as\n$$\nw(x) = v_0 \\sin \\alpha.\n$$\nFor angles of attack very close to zero $\\sin \\alpha \\approx \\alpha$, but contrary to the original derivation, we shall not make this simplification. From the definition of the normal force coefficient (3.1) and equation (3.15) we obtain\n$$\nC_N(x) = \\frac{N(x)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{2 \\sin \\alpha}{A_{\\text{ref}}} \\frac{dA(x)}{dx}.\n$$\nAssuming that the derivative $\\frac{dA(x)}{dx}$ is well-defined, we can integrate over the component length $l$ to obtain\n$$\nC_N = \\frac{2 \\sin \\alpha}{A_{\\text{ref}}} \\int_0^l \\frac{dA(x)}{dx} , dx = \\frac{2 \\sin \\alpha}{A_{\\text{ref}}} [A(l) - A(0)].\n$$\nWe then have\n$$\nC_{N_\\alpha} = \\frac{C_N}{\\alpha} = \\frac{2}{A_{\\text{ref}}} [A(l) - A(0)] \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\alpha} \\xrightarrow{\\alpha \\to 0} 1.\n$$\nThis is the same equation as derived by Barrowman with the exception of the correction term $\\sin \\alpha/\\alpha$.\nEquation (3.19) shows that as long as the cross-sectional area of the component changes smoothly, the normal force coefficient derivative does not depend on the component shape, only the difference of the cross-sectional area at the beginning and end. As a consequence, according to Barrowman’s theory, a cylindrical body tube has no effect on the normal force coefficient or CP location. However, the lift due to cylindrical body tube sections has been noted to be significant for long, slender rockets even at angles of attack of only a few degrees [13]. An extension for the effect of body lift will be given shortly.\n$ C_{m_\\alpha} $ of Body Components at Subsonic Speeds\nA normal force $N(x)$ at position $x$ produces a pitching moment\n$$\nm(x) = xN(x).\n$$\nat the nose cone tip. Therefore the pitching moment coefficient is\n$$\nC_m(x) = \\frac{m(x)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}} d} = \\frac{xN(x)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}} d}.\n$$\nSubstituting equation (3.17) we obtain\n$$\nC_m(x) = \\frac{x , C_N(x)}{d} = \\frac{2 \\sin \\alpha x}{A_{\\text{ref}} d} \\frac{dA(x)}{dx}.\n$$\nThis can be integrated over the length of the body to obtain\n$$\nC_m = \\frac{2 \\sin \\alpha}{A_{\\text{ref}} d} \\int_0^l x \\left( \\frac{dA(x)}{dx} \\right) dx = \\frac{2 \\sin \\alpha}{A_{\\text{ref}} d} \\left[ lA(l) - \\int_0^l A(x) , dx \\right].\n$$\nThe resulting integral is simply the volume of the body $V$. Therefore we have\n$$\nC_m = \\frac{2 \\sin \\alpha}{A_{\\text{ref}} d} \\left[ lA(l) - V \\right]\n$$\nand\n$$\nC_{m_\\alpha} = \\frac{2}{A_{\\text{ref}} d} \\left[ lA(l) - V \\right] \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\alpha}.\n$$\nThis is, again, the result derived by Barrowman with the additional correction term $\\sin \\alpha/\\alpha$.\nEffect of Body Lift\nThe analysis thus far has neglected the effect of body lift as negligible at small angles of attack. However, in the flight of long, slender rockets the lift may be quite significant at angles of attack of only a few degrees, which may occur at moderate wind speeds [13].\nRobert Galejs suggested adding a correction term to the body component $C_{N_\\alpha}$ to account for body lift [13]. The normal force exerted on a cylindrical body at an angle of attack $\\alpha$ is [15, p. 3-11]\n$$\nC_N = K \\frac{A_{\\text{plan}}}{A_{\\text{ref}}} \\sin^2 \\alpha\n$$\nwhere $A_{\\text{plan}} = d \\cdot l$ is the planform area of the cylinder and $K$ is a constant $K \\approx 1.1$. Galejs had simplified the equation with $\\sin^2 \\alpha \\approx \\alpha^2$, but this shall not be performed here. At small angles of attack, when the approximation is valid, this yields a linear correction to the value of $C_{N_\\alpha}$.\nIt is assumed that the lift on non-cylindrical components can be approximated reasonably well with the same equation. The CP location is assumed to be the center of the planform area, that is\n$$\nX_{\\text{lift}} = \\frac{\\int_0^l x, 2r(x), dx}{A_{\\text{plan}}}.\n$$\nThis is reminiscent of the CP of a rocket flying at an angle of attack of $90^\\circ$. For a cylinder, the CP location is at the center of the body, which is also the CP location obtained at the limit with equation (3.28). However, for nose cones, shoulders and boattails, it yields a slightly different position than equation (3.28).\nCenter of Pressure of Body Components\nThe CP location of the body components can be calculated by inserting equations (3.19) and (3.25) into equation (3.5):\n$$\nX_B = \\frac{(C_{m_\\alpha})_B}{(C_{N_\\alpha})_B} d\n$$\n$$\nX_B = \\frac{lA(l) - V}{A(l) - A(0)}\n$$\nIt is worth noting that the correction term $\\sin \\alpha/\\alpha$ cancels out in the division, however, it is still present in the value of $C_{N_\\alpha}$ and is therefore significant at large angles of attack.\nThe whole rocket body could be numerically integrated and the properties of the whole body computed. However, it is often more descriptive to split the body into components and calculate the parameters separately. The total CP location can be calculated from the separate CP locations $X_i$ and normal force coefficient derivatives $(C_{N_\\alpha})_i$ by the moment sum\n$$\nX = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i (C_{N_\\alpha})_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (C_{N_\\alpha})_i}.\n$$\nIn this manner, the effect of the separate components can be more easily analyzed.\n3.2.2 Planar Fins\nThe fins of the rocket are considered separately from the body. Their CP location and normal force coefficient are determined and added to the total moment sum (3.29). The interference between the fins and the body is taken into account by a separate correction term.\nIn addition to the corrective normal force, the fins can induce a roll rate if each of the fins are canted at an angle $\\delta$. The roll moment coefficient will be derived separately in Section 3.3.\nBarrowman’s original report and thesis derived the equations for trapezoidal fins, where the tip chord is parallel to the body (Figure 3.2(a)). The equations can be extended to, e.g., elliptical fins [16] (Figure 3.2(b)), but many model rocket fin designs depart from these basic shapes. Therefore an extension is presented that approximates the aerodynamical properties for a free-form fin defined by a list of $(x, y)$ coordinates (Figure 3.2(c)).\nAdditionally, Barrowman considered only cases with three or four fins. This shall be extended to allow for any reasonable number of fins, even single fins.\n\nFigure 3.2: Fin geometry of (a) a trapezoidal fin, (b) an elliptical fin, and (c) a free-form fin.\nCenter of Pressure of Fins at Subsonic and Supersonic Speeds\nBarrowman argued that since the CP of a fin is located along its mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) and on the other hand at low subsonic speeds on its quarter chord, then the CP must be located at the intersection of these two (depicted in Figure 3.2(a)). He proceeded to calculate this intersection point analytically from the fin geometry of a trapezoidal fin.\nInstead of following the derivation Barrowman used, an alternative method will be presented that allows simpler extension to free-form fins. The two methods yield identical results for trapezoidal fins. The length of the MAC $\\bar{c}$, its spanwise position $y_{\\text{MAC}}$, and the effective leading edge location $x_{\\text{MAC,LE}}$ are given by [17]\n$$\n\\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{fin}}} \\int_0^s c^2(y) , dy\n$$\n$$\ny_{\\text{MAC}} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{fin}}} \\int_0^s y c(y) , dy\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\text{MAC,LE}} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{fin}}} \\int_0^s x_{\\text{LE}}(y)c(y) , dy\n$$\nwhere $A_{\\text{fin}}$ is the one-sided area of a single fin, $s$ is the span of one fin, and $c(y)$ is the length of the fin chord and $x_{\\text{LE}}(y)$ the leading edge position at spanwise position $y$.\nWhen these equations are applied to trapezoidal fins and the lengthwise position of the CP is selected at the quarter chord, $X_f = x_{\\text{MAC,LE}} + 0.25 \\bar{c}$.\none recovers exactly the results derived by Barrowman:\n$$\ny_{\\text{MAC}} = \\frac{s}{3} \\frac{C_r + 2C_t}{C_r + C_t}\n$$\n$$\nX_f = \\frac{X_t}{3} \\frac{C_r + 2C_t}{C_r + C_t} + \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{C_r^2 + C_t^2 + C_r C_t}{C_r + C_t}\n$$\nHowever, equations (3.30)–(3.32) may also be directly applied to elliptical or free-form fins.\nBarrowman’s method assumes that the lengthwise position of the CP stays at a constant 25% of the MAC at subsonic speeds. However, the position starts moving rearward above approximately Mach 0.5. For $M &gt; 2$ the relative lengthwise position of the CP is given by an empirical formula [18, p. 33]\n$$\n\\frac{X_f}{\\bar{c}} = \\frac{\\mathcal{🜇} \\beta - 0.67}{2 \\mathcal{🜇} \\beta - 1}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = \\sqrt{M^2 - 1}$ for $M &gt; 1$ and $\\mathcal{🜇}$ is the aspect ratio of the fin defined using the span as $\\mathcal{🜇} = 2s^2/A_{\\text{fin}}$. Between Mach 0.5 and 2 the lengthwise position of the CP is interpolated. A suitable function that gives a curve similar to that of Figure 2.18 of reference [18, p. 33] was found to be a fifth order polynomial $p(M)$ with the constraints\n$ p(0.5) = 0.25 $\n$ p'(0.5) = 0 $\n$ p(2) = f(2) $\n$ p'(2) = f'(2) $\n$ p''(2) = 0 $\n$ p'''(2) = 0 $\nwhere $f(M)$ is the function of equation (3.35).\nThe method presented here can be used to estimate the CP location of an arbitrary thin fin. However, problems arise with the method if the fin shape has a jagged edge as shown in Figure 3.3(a). If $c(y)$ would include only the sum of the two separate chords in the area containing the gap, then the equations would yield the same result as for a fin shown in Figure 3.3(b). This clearly would be incorrect, since the position of the latter fin portion would be neglected. To overcome this problem, $c(y)$ is chosen as the length from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the fin, effectively adding the required contributions.\n\nFigure 3.3: (a) A jagged fin edge, and (b) an equivalent fin if $c(y)$ is chosen to include only the actual fin area.\nportion marked by the dotted line to the fin. This corrects the CP position slightly rearwards. The fin area used in equations (3.30)–(3.32) must in this case also be calculated including this extra fin area, but the extra area must not be included when calculating the normal force coefficient.\nThis correction is also approximate, since in reality such a jagged edge would cause some unknown interference factor between the two fin portions. Simulating such jagged edges using these methods should therefore be avoided.\nSingle Fin $C_{N_\\alpha}$ at Subsonic Speeds\nBarrowman derived the normal force coefficient derivative value based on Diederich’s semi-empirical method [19], which states that for one fin\n$$\n(C_{N_\\alpha})_1 =\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C_{{N_\\alpha}0} F_D \\left( \\frac{A_{\\text{fin}}}{A_{\\text{ref}}} \\right) \\cos \\Gamma_c}{2 + F_D \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4}{F_D^2}}}\n$$\nwhere\n\n$C_{{N_\\alpha}0} =$ normal force coefficient derivative of a 2D airfoil\n$F_D =$ Diederich’s planform correlation parameter\n$A_{\\text{fin}} =$ area of one fin\n$\\Gamma_c =$ midchord sweep angle (depicted in Figure 3.2(a)).\n\n\nBased on thin airfoil theory of potential flow corrected for compressible flow\n$$\nC_{N_{\\alpha_0}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - M^2}$ for $M &lt; 1$. $F_D$ is a parameter that corrects the normal force coefficient for the sweep of the fin. According to Diederich, $F_D$ is given by\n$$\nF_D = \\frac{\\mathcal{🜇}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} C_{N_{\\alpha_0}} \\cos \\Gamma_c}.\n$$\nSubstituting equations (3.38), (3.39) and $\\mathcal{🜇} = 2s^2/A_{\\text{fin}}$ into (3.37) and simplifying one obtains\n$$\n(C_{N_\\alpha})_1 =\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi \\frac{s^2}{A_{\\text{ref}}}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\beta s^2}{A_{\\text{fin}} \\cos \\Gamma_c}\\right)^2}}\n$$\nThis is the normal force coefficient derivative for one fin, where the angle of attack is between the airflow and fin surface.\nThe value of equation (3.40) can be calculated directly for trapezoidal and elliptical fins. However, in the case of free-form fins, the question arises of how to define the midchord angle $\\Gamma_c$. If the angle $\\Gamma_c$ is taken as the angle from the middle of the root chord to the tip of the fin, the result may not be representative of the actual shape, as shown by angle $\\Gamma_{c1}$ in Figure 3.4.\nInstead, the fin planform is divided into a large number of chords, and the angle between the midpoints of each two consecutive chords is calculated. The midchord angle used in equation (3.40) is then the average of all these angles. This produces an angle better representing the actual shape of the fin, as angle $\\Gamma_{c2}$ in Figure 3.4. The angle calculated by this method is also equal to the natural midchord angles for trapezoidal and elliptical fins.\n\nSingle Fin $C_{N_\\alpha}$ at Supersonic Speeds\nThe method for calculating the normal force coefficient of fins at supersonic speed presented by Barrowman is based on a third-order expansion according to Busemann theory [20]. The method divides the fin into narrow streamwise strips, the normal force of which are calculated separately. In this presentation, the method is further simplified by assuming the fins to be flat plates and by ignoring a third-order term that corrects for fin-tip Mach cone effects.\nThe local pressure coefficient of strip $i$ is calculated by\n$$\nC_{P_i} = K_1 \\eta_i + K_2 \\eta_i^2 + K_3 \\eta_i^3\n$$\nwhere $\\eta_i$ is the inclination of the flow at the surface and the coefficients are\n$$\nK_1 = \\frac{2}{\\beta}\n$$\n$$\nK_2 = \\frac{(\\gamma + 1)M^4 - 4 \\beta^2}{4 \\beta^4}\n$$\n$$\nK_3 = \\frac{(\\gamma + 1)M^8 + (2\\gamma^2 - 7\\gamma - 5)M^6 + 10(\\gamma + 1)M^4 + 8}{6 \\beta^7}\n$$\nIt is noteworthy that the coefficients $K_1$, $K_2$, and $K_3$ can be pre-calculated for various Mach numbers, which makes the pressure coefficient of a single strip very fast to compute. At small angles of inclination, the pressure coefficient is nearly linear, as presented in Figure 3.5.\nThe lift force of strip $i$ is equal to\n$$\nF_i = C_{P_i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 \\cdot c_i \\Delta y.\n$$\nThe total lift force of the fin is obtained by summing up the contributions of all fin strips. The normal force coefficient is then calculated in the usual manner as\n$$\nC_N = \\frac{\\sum_i F_i}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{ref}}} \\sum_i C_{P_i} \\cdot c_i \\Delta y.\n$$\nWhen computing the corrective normal force coefficient of the fins, the effect of roll is not taken into account. In this case, and assuming that the fins are flat plates, the inclination angles $\\eta_i$ of all strips are the same, and the pressure coefficient is constant over the entire fin. Therefore the normal force coefficient is simply\n$$\n(C_N)_1 = \\frac{A_{\\text{fin}}}{A_{\\text{ref}}} C_P.\n$$\nSince the pressure coefficient is not linear with the angle of attack, the normal force coefficient slope is defined using equation (3.8) as\n$$\n(C_{N_\\alpha})_1 = \\frac{(C_N)_1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{A_{\\text{fin}}}{A_{\\text{ref}}} \\left( K_1 + K_2 \\alpha + K_3 \\alpha^2 \\right).\n$$\nMultiple Fin $C_{N_\\alpha}$\nIn his thesis, Barrowman considered only configurations with three and four fins, one of which was parallel to the lateral airflow. For simulation purposes, it is necessary to lift these restrictions to allow for any direction of lateral airflow and for any number of fins.\nThe lift force of a fin is perpendicular to the fin and originates from its CP. Therefore a single fin may cause a rolling and yawing moment in addition to a pitching moment. In this case, all of the forces and moments must be computed from the geometry. If there are two or more fins placed symmetrically around the body, then the yawing moments cancel, and if additionally, there are any such configurations, the process is simplified.\n\nis no fin cant, then the total rolling moment is also zero, and these moments need not be computed.\nThe geometry of an uncanted fin configuration is depicted in Figure 3.6. The dihedral angle between each of the fins and the airflow direction is denoted $\\Lambda_i$. The fin $i$ encounters a local angle of attack of\n$$\n\\alpha_i = \\alpha \\sin \\Lambda_i\n$$\nfor which the normal force component (the component parallel to the lateral airflow) is then\n$$\n(C_{N_\\alpha})_{\\Lambda_i} = (C_{N_\\alpha})_1 \\sin^2 \\Lambda_i.\n$$\nThe sum of the coefficients for $N$ fins then yields\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^N (C_{N_\\alpha})_{\\Lambda_k} = (C_{N_\\alpha})_1 \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sin^2 \\Lambda_k.\n$$\nHowever, when $N \\geq 3$ and the fins are spaced equally around the body of the rocket, the sum simplifies to a constant\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^N \\sin^2(2\\pi k/N + \\theta) = \\frac{N}{2}.\n$$\nThis equation predicts that the normal force produced by three or more fins is independent of the roll angle $\\theta$ of the vehicle. Investigation by Pettis [21] showed that the normal force coefficient derivative of a four-finned rocket at Mach 1.48 decreased by approximately 6% at a roll angle of 45°, and the roll angle had negligible effect on an eight-finned rocket. Experimental data of a four-finned sounding rocket at Mach speeds from 0.60 to 1.20 supports the 6% estimate [22].\nThe only experimental data available to the author of three-fin configurations was of a rocket with a rounded triangular body cross section [23]. This data suggests an effect of approximately 15% on the normal force coefficient derivative depending on the roll angle. However, it is unknown how much of this effect is due to the triangular body shape and how much from the fin positioning.\nIt is also hard to predict such an effect when examining singular fins. If three identical or very similar singular fins are placed on a rocket body, the effect should be the same as when the fins belong to the same three-fin configuration. Due to these facts, the effect of the roll angle on the normal force coefficient derivative is ignored when a fin configuration has three or more fins1.\nHowever, in configurations with many fins, the fin–fin interference may cause the normal force to be less than that estimated directly by equation (3.52). According to reference [24, p. 5-24], the normal force coefficients for six and eight-fin configurations are 1.37 and 1.62 times that of the corresponding four-fin configuration, respectively. The values for five and seven-fin configurations are interpolated between these values.\n\n1\nIn OpenRocket versions prior to 0.9.6 a sinusoidal reduction of 15% and 6% was applied to three- and four-fin configurations, respectively. However, this sometimes caused a significantly different predicted CP location compared to the pure Barrowman method, and also caused a discrepancy when such a fin configuration was decomposed into singular fins. It was deemed better to follow the tested and tried Barrowman method instead of introducing additional terms to the equation.\n\n\nAltogether, the normal force coefficient derivative $(C_{N_\\alpha})_N$ is calculated by:\n$$\n(C_{N_\\alpha})_N = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sin^2 \\Lambda_k \\right) (C_{N_\\alpha})_1 \\times\n\\begin{cases}\n1.000 &amp; N_{\\text{tot}} = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\newline \\\n0.948 &amp; N_{\\text{tot}} = 5 \\newline \\\n0.913 &amp; N_{\\text{tot}} = 6 \\newline \\\n0.854 &amp; N_{\\text{tot}} = 7 \\newline \\\n0.810 &amp; N_{\\text{tot}} = 8 \\newline \\\n0.750 &amp; N_{\\text{tot}} &gt; 8\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nHere $N$ is the number of fins in this fin set, while $N_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total number of parallel fins that have an interference effect. The sum term simplifies to $N/2$ for $N \\geq 3$ according to equation (3.53). The interference effect for $N_{\\text{tot}} &gt; 8$ is assumed at 25%, as data for such configurations is not available and such configurations are rare and eccentric in any case.\nFin–Body Interference\nThe normal force coefficient must still be corrected for fin–body interference, which increases the overall produced normal force. Here two distinct effects can be identified: the normal force on the fins due to the presence of the body and the normal force on the body due to the presence of fins. Of these, the former is significantly larger; the latter is therefore ignored. The effect of the extra fin lift is taken into account using a correction term\n$$\n(C_{N_\\alpha})_{T(B)} = K_{T(B)} (C_{N_\\alpha})_N\n$$\nwhere $(C_{N_\\alpha})_{T(B)}$ is the normal force coefficient derivative of the tail in the presence of the body. The term $K_{T(B)}$ can be approximated by [3]\n$$\nK_{T(B)} = 1 + \\frac{r_t}{s + r_t},\n$$\nwhere $s$ is the fin span from root to tip and $r_t$ is the body radius at the fin position. The value $(C_{N_\\alpha})_{T(B)}$ is then used as the final normal force coefficient derivative of the fins.\n\n3.2.3 Pitch Damping Moment\nSo far, the effect of the current pitch angular velocity has been ignored as marginal. This is the case during the upward flight of a stable rocket. However, if a rocket is launched nearly vertically in still air, the rocket flips over rather rapidly at apogee. In some cases, it was observed that the rocket was left wildly oscillating during descent. The pitch damping moment opposes the fast rotation of the rocket, thus damping the oscillation.\nSince the pitch damping moment is notable only at apogee, and therefore does not contribute to the overall flight characteristics, only a rough estimate of its magnitude is required. A cylinder in perpendicular flow has a drag coefficient of approximately $C_D = 1.1$, with the reference area being the planform area of the cylinder [15, p. 3-11]. Therefore a short piece of cylinder $d\\xi$ at a distance $\\xi$ from a rotation axis, as shown in Figure 3.7, produces a force\n$$\ndF = 1.1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (\\omega \\xi)^2 \\cdot \\frac{2r_t , d\\xi}{\\text{ref. area}}\n$$\nwhen the cylinder is rotating at an angular velocity $\\omega$. The produced moment is correspondingly $dm = \\xi , dF$. Integrating this over $0 \\ldots l$ yields the total pitch moment\n$$\nm = 0.275 \\cdot \\rho_t , l^4 \\omega^2\n$$\nand thus the moment damping coefficient is\n$$\nC_{\\text{damp}} = 0.55 \\cdot \\frac{l^4 , r_t}{A_{\\text{ref}} , d} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega^2}{v_0^2}.\n$$\nThis value is computed separately for the portions of the rocket body fore and aft of the CG using an average body radius as $r_t$.\nSimilarly, a fin with area $A_{\\text{fin}}$ at a distance $\\xi$ from the CG produces a moment of approximately\n$$\nC_{\\text{damp}} = 0.6 \\cdot \\frac{N , A_{\\text{fin}} , \\xi^3 , s}{A_{\\text{ref}} , d} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega^2}{v_0^2}\n$$\nwhere the effective area of the fins is assumed to be $A_{\\text{fin}} \\cdot N/2$. For $N &gt; 4$ the value $N = 4$ is used, since the other fins are not exposed to any direct airflow.\nThe damping moments are applied to the total pitch moment in the opposite direction of the current pitch rate. It is noteworthy that the damping moment coefficients are proportional to $\\omega^2 / v_0^2$, confirming that the damping moments are insignificant during most of the rocket flight, where the angles of deflection are small and the velocity of the rocket large. Through roll coupling, the yaw rate may also momentarily become significant, and therefore the same correction is also applied to the yaw moment.\n3.3 Roll Dynamics\nWhen the fins of a rocket are canted at some angle $\\delta &gt; 0$, the fins induce a rolling moment on the rocket. On the other hand, when a rocket has a specific roll velocity, the portions of the fin far from the rocket centerline encounter notable tangential velocities which oppose the roll. Therefore a steady-state roll velocity, dependent on the current velocity of the rocket, will result.\nThe effect of roll on a fin can be examined by dividing the fin into narrow streamwise strips and later integrating over the strips. A strip $i$ at distance $\\xi_i$ from the rocket centerline encounters a radial velocity\n$$\nu_i = \\omega \\xi_i\n$$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular roll velocity, as shown in Figure 3.8. The radial velocity induces an angle of attack\n$$\n\\eta_i = \\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{u_i}{v_0}\\right) = \\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{\\omega \\xi_i}{v_0}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\omega \\xi_i}{v_0}\n$$\nto the strip. The approximation $\\tan^{-1} \\eta \\approx \\eta$ is valid for $u_i \\ll v_0$, that is, when the velocity of the rocket is large compared to the radial velocity. The approximation is reasonable up to angles of $\\eta \\approx 20^\\circ$, above which angle most fins stall, which limits the validity of the equation in any case.\nWhen a fin is canted at an angle $\\delta$, the total inclination of the strip to the airflow is\n$$\n\\alpha_i = \\delta - \\eta_i.\n$$\nAssuming that the force produced by a strip is directly proportional to the local angle of attack, the force on strip $i$ is\n$$\nF_i = k_i \\alpha_i = k_i (\\delta - \\eta_i)\n$$\nfor some $k_i$. The total moment produced by the fin is then\n$$\nl = \\sum_i \\xi_i F_i = \\sum_i \\xi_i k_i (\\delta - \\eta_i) = \\sum_i \\xi_i k_i \\delta - \\sum_i \\xi_i k_i \\eta_i.\n$$\nThis shows that the effect of roll can be split into two components: the first term $\\sum_i \\xi_i k_i \\delta$ is the roll moment induced by a fin canted at the angle $\\delta$ when there is no roll velocity, and the second term accounts for the opposition to roll due to radial velocities.\n\nflying at zero roll rate ($\\omega = 0$), while the second term $\\sum_i \\xi_i k_i \\eta_i$ is the opposing moment generated by an uncanted fin ($\\delta = 0$) when flying at a roll rate $\\omega$. These two moments are called the roll forcing moment and roll damping moment, respectively. These components will be analyzed separately.\n3.3.1 Roll Forcing Coefficient\nAs shown previously, the roll forcing coefficient can be computed by examining a rocket with fins canted at an angle $\\delta$ flying at zero roll rate ($\\omega = 0$). In this case, the cant angle $\\delta$ acts simply as an angle of attack for each of the fins. Therefore, the methods computed in the previous section can be directly applied. Because the lift force of a fin originates from the mean aerodynamic chord, the roll forcing coefficient of $N$ fins is equal to\n$$\nC_{lf} = \\frac{N(y_{\\text{MAC}} + r_t) (C_{N_\\alpha})_1 \\delta}{d}\n$$\nwhere $y_{\\text{MAC}}$ and $(C_{N_\\alpha})_1$ are computed using the methods described in Section 3.2.2 and $r_t$ is the radius of the body tube at the fin position. This result is applicable for both subsonic and supersonic speeds.\n3.3.2 Roll Damping Coefficient\nThe roll damping coefficient is computed by examining a rocket with uncanted fins ($\\delta = 0$) flying at a roll rate $\\omega$. Since different portions of the fin encounter different local angles of attack, the damping moment must be computed from the separate streamwise airfoil strips.\nAt subsonic speeds the force generated by strip $i$ is equal to\n$$\nF_i = C_{N_{\\alpha_0}} \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 , c_i \\Delta \\xi_i , \\eta_i.\n$$\nHere $C_{N_{\\alpha_0}}$ is calculated by equation (3.38) and $c_i \\Delta \\xi_i$ is the area of the strip. The roll damping moment generated by the strip is then\n$$\n(C_{ld})_i = \\frac{F_i \\xi_i}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{ref}} , d} = \\frac{C_{N_{\\alpha_0}}}{A_{\\text{ref}} , d} , \\xi_i c_i \\Delta \\xi_i , \\eta_i.\n$$\nBy applying the approximation (3.62) and summing (integrating) the airfoil strips, the total roll damping moment for $N$ fins is obtained as:\n$$\nC_{ld} = N \\sum_i (C_{ld})_i = \\frac{N , C_{N_{\\alpha_0}} , \\omega}{A_{\\text{ref}} , d , v_0} \\sum_i c_i \\xi_i^2 \\Delta \\xi_i.\n$$\nThe sum term is a constant for a specific fin shape. It can be computed numerically from the strips or analytically for specific shapes. For trapezoidal fins the term can be integrated as\n$$\n\\sum_i c_i \\xi_i^2 \\Delta \\xi_i = \\frac{C_r + C_t}{2} , r_t^2 s + \\frac{C_r + 2C_t}{3} , r_t s^2 + \\frac{C_r + 3C_t}{12} , s^3\n$$\nand for elliptical fins\n$$\n\\sum_i c_i \\xi_i^2 \\Delta \\xi_i = C_r \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} , r_t^2 s + \\frac{2}{3} , r_t s^2 + \\frac{\\pi}{16} , s^3 \\right).\n$$\nThe roll damping moment at supersonic speeds is calculated analogously, starting from the supersonic strip lift force, equation (3.45), where the angle of inclination of each strip is calculated using equation (3.62). The roll moment at supersonic speeds is thus\n$$\nC_{ld} = \\frac{N}{A_{\\text{ref}} , d} \\sum_i C_{P_i} , c_i \\xi_i \\Delta \\xi_i.\n$$\nThe dependence on the incidence angle $\\eta_i$ is embedded within the local pressure coefficient $C_{P_i}$, equation (3.41). Since the dependence is non-linear, the sum term is a function of the Mach number as well as the fin shape.\n3.3.3 Equilibrium Roll Frequency\nOne quantity of interest when examining rockets with canted fins is the steady-state roll frequency that the fins induce on a rocket flying at a specific velocity. This is obtained by equating the roll forcing moment (3.66) and roll damping moment (3.69) and solving for the roll rate $\\omega$. The equilibrium roll frequency at subsonic speeds is therefore\n$$\nf_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{\\omega_{\\text{eq}}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{A_{\\text{ref}} , \\beta v_0 , y_{\\text{MAC}} (C_{N_\\alpha})_1 , \\delta}{4\\pi^2 \\sum_i c_i \\xi_i^2 \\Delta \\xi_i}\n$$\nIt is worth noting that the arbitrary reference area $A_{\\text{ref}}$ is cancelled out by the reference area appearing within $(C_{N_\\alpha})_1$, as is to be expected.\nAt supersonic speeds the dependence on the incidence angle is non-linear and therefore the equilibrium roll frequency must be solved numerically. Alternatively, the second and third-order terms of the local pressure coefficient of equation (3.41) may be ignored, in which case an approximation for the equilibrium roll frequency nearly identical to the subsonic case is obtained:\n$$\nf_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{\\omega_{\\text{eq}}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{A_{\\text{ref}} , \\beta v_0 , y_{\\text{MAC}} (C_{N_\\alpha})_1 , \\delta}{4\\pi \\sum_i c_i \\xi_i^2 \\Delta \\xi_i}\n$$\nThe value of $(C_{N_\\alpha})_1$ must, of course, be computed using different methods in the subsonic and supersonic cases.\n3.4 Drag Forces\nAir flowing around a solid body causes drag, which resists the movement of the object relative to the air. Drag forces arise from two basic mechanisms, the air pressure distribution around the rocket and skin friction. The pressure distribution is further divided into body pressure drag (including shock waves generated at supersonic speeds), parasitic pressure drag due to protrusions such as launch lugs and base drag. Additional sources of drag include interference between the fins and body and vortices generated at fin tips when flying at an angle of attack. The different drag sources are depicted in Figure 3.9. Each drag source will be analyzed separately; the interference drag and fin-tip vortices will be ignored as small compared to the other sources.\nAs described in Section 3.1, two different drag coefficients can be defined: the (total) drag coefficient $C_D$ and the axial drag coefficient $C_A$. At zero angle of attack these two coincide, $C_{D0} = C_{A0}$, but at other angles a distinction between the two must be made. The value of significance in the simulation is the axial drag coefficient $C_A$ based on the choice of force components. However, the drag coefficient $C_D$ describes the deceleration force on the rocket, and is a more commonly known value in the rocketry community, so it is informational to calculate its value as well.\nIn this section the zero angle-of-attack drag coefficient $C_{D0} = C_{A0}$ will be computed first. Then, in Section 3.4.7 this will be extended for angles of attack and $C_A$ and $C_D$ will be computed. Since the drag force of each component is proportional to its particular size, the subscript $\\bullet$ will be used for coefficients that are computed using the reference area of the specific component. This reference area is the frontal area of the component unless otherwise noted. Conversion to the global reference area is performed by\n$$\nC_{D0} = \\frac{A_{\\text{component}}}{A_{\\text{ref}}} \\cdot C_{D\\bullet}.\n$$\n3.4.1 Laminar and Turbulent Boundary Layers\nAt the front of a streamlined body, air flows smoothly around the body in layers, each of which has a different velocity. The layer closest to the surface\n\n\"sticks\" to the object having zero velocity. Each layer gradually increases the speed until the free-stream velocity is reached. This type of flow is said to be laminar and to have a laminar boundary layer. The thickness of the boundary layer increases with the distance the air has flowed along the surface. At some point a transition occurs and the layers of air begin to mix. The boundary layer becomes turbulent and thickens rapidly. This transition is depicted in Figure 3.9.\nA turbulent boundary layer induces a notably larger skin friction drag than a laminar boundary layer. It is therefore necessary to consider how large a portion of a rocket is in laminar flow and at what point the flow becomes turbulent. The point at which the flow becomes turbulent is the point that has a local critical Reynolds number\n$$\nR_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{v_0 , x}{\\nu},\n$$\nwhere $v_0$ is the free-stream air velocity, $x$ is the distance along the body from the nose cone tip and $\\nu \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} , \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$ is the kinematic viscosity of air. The critical Reynolds number is approximately $R_{\\text{crit}} = 5 \\times 10^5$ [4, p. 43]. Therefore, at a velocity of 100 m/s the transition therefore occurs approximately 7 cm from the nose cone tip.\nSurface roughness or even slight protrusions may also trigger the transition to occur prematurely. At a velocity of 60 m/s the critical height for a cylindrical protrusion all around the body is of the order of 0.05 mm [14, p. 348]. The body-to-nosecone joint, a severed paintbrush hair or some other imperfection on the surface may easily exceed this limit and cause premature transition to occur.\nBarrowman presents methods for computing the drag of both fully turbulent boundary layers as well as partially-laminar layers. Both methods were implemented and tested, but the difference in apogee altitude was less than 5% in with all tested designs. Therefore, the boundary layer is assumed to be fully turbulent in all cases.\n3.4.2 Skin Friction Drag\nSkin friction is one of the most notable sources of model rocket drag. It is caused by the friction of the viscous flow of air around the rocket. In his thesis, Barrowman presented formulae for estimating the skin friction coefficient for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers as well as the transition between the two [4, pp. 43–47]. As discussed above, a fully turbulent boundary layer will be assumed in this thesis.\nThe skin friction coefficient $C_f$ is defined as the drag coefficient due to friction with the reference area being the total wetted area of the rocket, that is, the body and fin area in contact with the airflow:\n$$\nC_f = \\frac{D_{\\text{friction}}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A_{\\text{wet}}}\n$$\nThe coefficient is a function of the rocket’s Reynolds number $R$ and the surface roughness. The aim is to first calculate the skin friction coefficient, then apply corrections due to compressibility and geometry effects, and finally to convert the coefficient to the proper reference area.\nSkin Friction Coefficients\nTable 3.2: Approximate roughness heights of different surfaces [15, p. 5-3]\nType of SurfaceHeight / µm\nAverage glass0.1\nFinished and polished surface0.5\nOptimum paint-sprayed surface5\nPlaned wooden boards15\nPaint in aircraft mass production20\nSmooth cement surface50\nDip-galvanized metal surface150\nIncorrectly sprayed aircraft paint200\nRaw wooden boards500\nAverage concrete surface1000\n\nThe values for $C_f$ are given by different formulae depending on the Reynolds number. For fully turbulent flow, the coefficient is given by\n$$\nC_f = \\frac{1}{\\left(1.50 \\ln R - 5.6\\right)^2}.\n$$\nThe above formula assumes that the surface is \\smooth\" and the surface roughness is completely submerged in a thin, laminar sublayer. At sufficient speeds even slight roughness may have an e ect on the skin friction. The critical Reynolds number corresponding to the roughness is given by\n$$\nR_{\\text{crit}} = 51 \\left(\\frac{R_s}{L}\\right)^{-1.039},\n$$\nwhere $R_s$ is an approximate roughness height of the surface. A few typical roughness heights are presented in Table 3.2. For Reynolds numbers above the critical value, the skin friction coefficient can be considered independent of Reynolds number, and has a value of\n$$\nC_f = 0.032 \\left(\\frac{R_s}{L}\\right)^{0.2}.\n$$\nFinally, a correction must be made for very low Reynolds numbers. The experimental formulae are applicable above approximately $R \\approx 10^4$. This corresponds to velocities typically below 1 m/s, which therefore have negligible effect on simulations. Below this Reynolds number, the skin friction coefficient is assumed to be equal as for $R = 10^4$.\nAltogether, the skin friction coefficient for turbulent flow is calculated by\n$$\nC_f =\n\\begin{cases}\n1.48 \\times 10^{-2}, &amp; \\text{if } R &lt; 10^4 \\newline \\\n\\text{Eq. (3.78)}, &amp; \\text{if } 10^4 &lt; R &lt; R_{\\text{crit}} \\newline \\\n\\text{Eq. (3.80)}, &amp; \\text{if } R &gt; R_{\\text{crit}}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThese formulae are plotted with a few different surface roughnesses in Figure 3.10. Included also is the laminar and transitional skin friction values for comparison.\nCompressibility Corrections\nAt subsonic speeds, the skin friction coefficient turbulent and roughness-limited boundary layers need to be corrected for compressibility with the factor\n$$\nC_{fc} = C_f \\left(1 - 0.1 M^2\\right).  \\qquad (3.82)\n$$\nIn supersonic flow, the turbulent skin friction coefficient must be corrected with\n$$\nC_{fc} = \\frac{C_f}{\\left(1 + 0.15 M^2\\right)^{0.58}} \\qquad (3.83)\n$$\nand the roughness-limited value with\n$$\nC_{fc} = \\frac{C_f}{1 + 0.18 M^2}. \\qquad (3.84)\n$$\nHowever, the corrected roughness-limited value should not be used if it would yield a value smaller than the corresponding turbulent value.\nSkin Friction Drag Coefficient\nAfter correcting the skin friction coefficient for compressibility effects, the coefficient can be converted into the actual drag coefficient. This is performed by scaling it to the correct reference area. The body wetted area is corrected for its cylindrical geometry, and the fins for their finite thickness. The total friction drag coefficient is then\n$$\n(C_D)_{\\text{friction}} = C_{f_c} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2f_B}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{A_{\\text{wet, body}} + \\left(1 + \\frac{2t}{\\bar{c}}\\right) \\cdot A_{\\text{wet, fins}}}{A_{\\text{ref}}}  \\quad (3.85)\n$$\nwhere $f_B$ is the fineness ratio of the rocket, $t$ the thickness and $\\bar{c}$ the mean aerodynamic chord length of the fins. The wetted area of the fins $A_{\\text{wet, fins}}$ includes both sides of the fins.\n3.4.3 Body Pressure Drag\nPressure drag is caused by the air being forced around the rocket. A special case of pressure drag are shock waves generated at supersonic speeds. In this section, methods for estimating the pressure drag of nose cones will be presented and reasonable estimates also for shoulders and boattails.\nNose Cone Pressure Drag\nAt subsonic speeds, the pressure drag of streamlined nose cones is significantly smaller than the skin friction drag. In fact, suitable shapes may even yield negative pressure drag coefficients, producing a slight reduction in drag. Figure 3.11 presents various nose cone shapes and their respective measured pressure drag coefficients. [15, p. 3-12]\nIt is notable that even a slight rounding at the joint between the nose cone and body reduces the drag coefficient dramatically. Rounding the edges of an otherwise flat head reduces the drag coefficient from 0.8 to 0.2, while a spherical nose cone has a coefficient of only 0.01. The only cases where an appreciable pressure drag is present is when the joint between the nose cone and body is not smooth, which may cause slight flow separation.\n\nThe nose pressure drag is approximately proportional to the square of the sine of the joint angle $\\phi$ (shown in Figure 3.11) [25, p. 237]:\n$$\n(C_{D_e, M=0})_p = 0.8 \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi.  \\qquad (3.86)\n$$\nThis yields a zero pressure drag for all nose cone shapes that have a smooth transition to the body. The equation does not take into account the effect of extremely blunt nose cones (length less than half of the diameter). Since the main drag cause is slight flow separation, the coefficient cannot be corrected for compressibility effects using the Prandtl coefficient, and the value is applicable only at low subsonic velocities.\nAt supersonic velocities shock waves increase the pressure drag dramatically. In his report, Barrowman uses a second-order shock-expansion method that allows determining the pressure distribution along an arbitrary slender rotationally symmetrical body [26]. However, the method has some problematic limitations. The method cannot handle body areas that have a slope larger than approximately 30°, present in several typical nose cone shapes. The local airflow in such areas may decrease below the speed of sound, and the method cannot handle transonic effects. Drag in the transonic region is of special interest for rocketeers wishing to build rockets capable of penetrating the sound barrier.\nInstead of a general piecewise computation of the air pressure around the nose cone, a simpler semi-empirical method for estimating the transonic and supersonic pressure drag of nose cones is used. The method, described in detail in Appendix B, combines theoretical and empirical data of different nose cone shapes to allow estimating the pressure drag of all the nose cone shapes described in Appendix A.\nThe semi-empirical method is used at Mach numbers above 0.8. At high subsonic velocities, the pressure drag is interpolated between that predicted by the detailed aerodynamic methods and the empirical method.\nby equation (3.86) and the transonic method. The pressure drag is assumed to be non-decreasing in the subsonic region and to have zero derivative at $M = 0$. A suitable interpolation function that resembles the shape of the Prandtl factor is\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{pressure}} = a \\cdot M^b + (C_{D_e,M=0})_p  \\qquad (3.87)\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are computed to fit the drag coefficient and its derivative at the lower bound of the transonic method.\nShoulder Pressure Drag\nNeither Barrowman nor Hoerner present theoretical or experimental data on the pressure drag of transitions at subsonic velocities. In the case of shoulders, the pressure drag coefficient is assumed to be the same as that of a nose cone, except that the reference area is the difference between the aft and fore ends of the transition. The effect of a non-smooth transition at the beginning of the shoulder is ignored, since this causes an increase in pressure and thus cannot cause flow separation.\nWhile this assumption is reasonable at subsonic velocities, it is somewhat dubious at supersonic velocities. However, no comprehensive data set of shoulder pressure drag at supersonic velocities was found. Therefore the same assumption is made for supersonic velocities and a warning is generated during such simulations (see Section 5.1.4). The refinement of the supersonic shoulder pressure drag estimation is left as a future enhancement.\nBoattail Pressure Drag\nThe estimate for boattail pressure drag is based on the body base drag estimate, which will be presented in Section 3.4.5. At one extreme, the transition length is zero, in which case the boattail pressure drag will be equal to the total base drag. On the other hand, a gentle slope will allow a gradual pressure change causing approximately zero pressure drag. Hoerner has presented pressure drag data for wedges, which suggests that at a length-to-height ratio below 1 has a constant pressure drag corresponding to the base drag and above a ratio of 3 the pressure drag is negligible. Based on this and the base drag data, boattail pressure drag can be reasonably estimated for design purposes.\nDrag equation (3.94), an approximation for the pressure drag of a boattail is given as\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{pressure}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{base}}}{A_{\\text{boattail}}} \\cdot (C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{base}} \\cdot\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &amp; \\text{if } \\gamma &lt; 1 \\newline \\\n\\frac{3 - \\gamma}{2} &amp; \\text{if } 1 &lt; \\gamma &lt; 3 \\newline \\\n0 &amp; \\text{if } \\gamma &gt; 3\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad (3.88)\n$$\nwhere the length-to-height ratio $\\gamma = l/(d_1 - d_2)$ is calculated from the length and fore and aft diameters of the boattail. The ratios 1 and 3 correspond to reduction angles of $27^\\circ$ and $9^\\circ$, respectively, for a conical boattail. The base drag $(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{base}}$ is calculated using equation (3.94).\nAgain, this approximation is made primarily based on subsonic data. At supersonic velocities, expansion fans exist, the counterpart of shock waves in expanding flow. However, the same equation is used for subsonic and supersonic flow and a warning is generated during transonic simulation of boattails.\n3.4.4 Fin Pressure Drag\nThe fin pressure drag is highly dependent on the fin profile shape. Three typical shapes are considered, a rectangular profile, rounded leading and trailing edges, and an airfoil shape with rounded leading edge and tapering trailing edge. Barrowman estimates the fin pressure drag by dividing the drag further into components of a finite thickness leading edge, thick trailing edge and overall fin thickness [4, p. 48–57]. In this report the fin thickness was already taken into account as a correction to the skin friction drag in Section 3.4.2. The division to leading and trailing edges also allows simple extension to the different profile shapes.\nThe drag of a rounded leading edge can be considered as a circular cylinder in cross flow with no base drag. Barrowman derived an empirical formula for the leading edge pressure drag as\n$$\n(C_D)_{\\perp, \\text{LE}} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\left(1 - M^2\\right)^{-0.417} - 1 &amp; \\text{for } M &lt; 0.9 \\newline \\\n\\frac{1}{1 - 1.785(M - 0.9)} &amp; \\text{for } 0.9 &lt; M &lt; 1 \\newline \\\n1.214 - \\frac{0.502}{M^2} + \\frac{0.1095}{M^4} &amp; \\text{for } M &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad (3.89)\n$$\nThe subscript $\\perp$ signifies the flow is perpendicular to the leading edge.\nIn the case of a rectangular fin profile, the leading edge pressure drag is equal to the stagnation pressure drag as derived in equation B.2 of Appendix B.1:\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{LE}\\perp} = (C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{stag}} \\qquad (3.90)\n$$\nThe leading edge pressure drag of a slanted fin is obtained from the cross-flow principle [15, p. 3-11] as\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{LE}} = (C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{LE}\\perp} \\cdot \\cos^2 \\Gamma_L \\qquad (3.91)\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma_L$ is the leading edge angle. Note that in the equation both coefficients are relative to the frontal area of the cylinder, so the ratio of their reference areas is also $\\cos \\Gamma_L$. In the case of a free-form fin, the angle $\\Gamma_L$ is the average leading edge angle, as described in Section 3.2.2.\nThe fin base drag coefficient of a square profile fin is the same as the body base drag coefficient in equation 3.94:\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{TE}} = (C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{base}} \\qquad (3.92)\n$$\nFor fins with rounded edges, the value is taken as half of the total base drag, and for fins with tapering trailing edges, the base drag is assumed to be zero.\nThe total fin pressure drag is the sum of the leading and trailing edge drags\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{pressure}} = (C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{LE}} + (C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{TE}}. \\qquad (3.93)\n$$\nThe reference area is the fin frontal area $N \\cdot ts$.\n3.4.5 Base Drag\nBase drag is caused by a low-pressure area created at the base of the rocket or in any place where the body radius diminishes rapidly enough. The magnitude of the base drag can be estimated using the empirical formula [18, p. 23]\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{base}} =\n\\begin{cases}\n0.12 + 0.13M^2, &amp; \\text{if } M &lt; 1 \\newline \\\n0.25/M, &amp; \\text{if } M &gt; 1 \\newline\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad (3.94)\n$$\nThe base drag is disrupted when a motor exhausts into the area. A full examination of the process would need much more detailed information about the exhaust dynamics and geometry of the rocket nozzle and base area.\n\nthe motor and would be unnecessarily complicated. A reasonable approximation is achieved by subtracting the area of the thrusting motors from the base reference area [18, p. 23]. Thus, if the base is the same size as the motor itself, no base drag is generated. On the other hand, if the base is large with only a small motor in the center, the base drag is approximately the same as when coasting.\nThe equation presented above ignores the effect that the rear body slope angle has on the base pressure. A boattail at the end of the rocket both diminishes the reference area of base drag, thus reducing drag, but the slope also directs air better into the low-pressure area. This effect has been neglected as small compared to the effect of reduced base area.\n3.4.6 Parasitic Drag\nParasitic drag refers to drag caused by imperfections and protrusions on the rocket body. The most significant source of parasitic drag in model rockets are the launch guides that protrude from the rocket body. The most common type of launch guide is one or two launch lugs, which are pieces of tube that hold the rocket on the launch rod during takeoff. Alternatives to launch lugs include replacing the tube with metal wire loops or attaching rail pins that hold the rocket on a launch rail. These three guide types are depicted in Figure 3.12. The effect of launch lugs on the total drag of a model rocket is small, typically in the range of 0–10%, due to their comparatively small size. However, studying this effect may be of notable interest for model rocket designers.\nA launch lug that is long enough that no appreciable airflow occurs through the lug may be considered a solid cylinder next to the main rocket body. A rectangular protrusion that has a length at least twice its height has a drag coefficient of 0.74, with reference area being its frontal area [15, p. 5-8]. The effect of such protrusions should be considered when optimizing designs for minimal drag.\ndrag coefficient varies proportional to the stagnation pressure as in the case of a blunt cylinder in free airflow, presented in Appendix B.1.\nA wire held perpendicular to airflow has instead a drag coefficient of 1.1, where the reference area is the planform area of the wire [15, p. 3-11]. A wire loop may be thought of as a launch lug with length and wall thickness equal to the thickness of the wire. However, in this view of a launch lug the reference area must not include the inside of the tube, since air is free to flow within the loop.\nThese two cases may be unified by changing the used reference area as a function of the length of the tube $l$. At the limit $l = 0$ the reference area is the simple planform area of the loop, and when the length is greater than the diameter $l &gt; d$ the reference area includes the inside of the tube as well. The slightly larger drag coefficient of the wire may be taken into account as a multiplier to the blunt cylinder drag coefficient.\nTherefore, the drag coefficient of a launch guide can be approximately calculated by\n$$\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{parasitic}} = \\max{1.3 - 0.3 , l/d, 1} \\cdot\n(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{stag}} \\qquad (3.95)\n$$\nwhere $(C_{D\\bullet})_{\\text{stag}}$ is the stagnation pressure coefficient calculated in equation (B.2), and the reference area is\n$$\nA_{\\text{parasitic}} = \\pi r_{\\text{ext}}^2 - \\pi r_{\\text{int}}^2 \\cdot \\max{1 - l/d, 0}. \\qquad (3.96)\n$$\nThis approximation may also be used to estimate the drag of rail pins. A circular pin protruding from a wall has a drag coefficient of 0.80 [15, p. 5-8]. Therefore the drag of the pin is approximately equal to that of a lug with the same frontal area. The rail pins can be approximated in a natural manner as launch lugs with the same frontal area as the pin and a length equal to their diameter.\n3.4.7 Axial Drag Coefficient\nThe total drag coefficient may be calculated by simply scaling the coefficients to a common reference area and adding them together:\n$$\nC_{D0} = \\sum_T \\frac{A_T}{A_{\\text{ref}}} (C_{D\\bullet})_T + (C_D)_{\\text{friction}} \\qquad (3.97)\n$$\nwhere the sum includes the pressure, base and parasitic drags. The friction drag was scaled to the reference area $ A_{ref} $ already in equation (3.85).\nThis yields the total drag coefficient at zero angle of attack. At an angle of attack the several phenomena begin to affect the drag. More frontal area is visible to the airflow, the pressure gradients along the body change and fin-tip vortices emerge. On the other hand, the drag force is no longer axial, so the axial drag force is less than the total drag force.\nBased on experimental data an empirical formula was produced for calculating the axial drag coefficient at an angle of attach $\\alpha$ from the zero-angle drag coefficient. The scaling function is a two-part polynomial function that starts from 1 at $\\alpha = 0^\\circ$, increases to 1.3 at $\\alpha = 17^\\circ$ and then decreases to zero at $\\alpha = 90^\\circ$; the derivative is also zero at these points. Since the majority of the simulated flight is at very small angles of attack, this approximation provides a sufficiently accurate estimate for the purposes of this thesis.\n3.5 Tumbling bodies\nIn staged rockets the lower stages of the rocket separate from the main rocket body and descend to the ground on their own. While large rockets typically have parachutes also in lower stages, most model rockets rely on the stages falling to the ground without any recovery device. As the lower stages normally are not aerodynamically stable, they tumble during descent, significantly reducing their speed.\nThis kind of tumbling is difficult if not impossible to model in 6-DOF, and the orientation is not of interest anyway. For simulating the descent of aerodynamically unstable stages, it is therefore sufficient to compute the average aerodynamic drag of the tumbling lower stage.\nWhile model rockets are built in very peculiar forms, staged rockets are typically much more conservative in their design. The lower stages are most often formed of just a body tube and fins. Five such models were constructed for testing their descent aerodynamic drag.\nModels #1 and #2 are identical except for the number of fins. #3 represents a large, high-power booster stage. #4 is a body tube without fins, and #5 fins without a body tube.\nTable 3.3: Physical properties and drop results of the lower stage models\nModel#1#2#3#4#5\nNo. fins34304\n$C_r$ / mm7070200-85\n$C_t$ / mm4040140-85\n$s$ / mm6060130-50\n$l_0$ / mm101025--\n$d$ / mm4444103440\n$l$ / mm108108290100-\n$m$ / g18.022.01606.811.5\n$v_0$ / m/s5.66.36.65.45.0\n\nThe models were dropped from a height of 22 meters and the drop was recorded on video. From the video frames the position of the component was determined and the terminal velocity $v_0$ calculated with an accuracy of approximately ±0.3 m/s. During the drop test the temperature was -5°C, relative humidity was 80% and the dew point -7°C. Together these yield an air density of $\\rho = 1.31 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. The physical properties of the models and their terminal descent velocities are listed in Table 3.3.\nFor a tumbling rocket, it is reasonable to assume that the drag force is relative to the profile area of the rocket. For body tubes the profile area is straightforward to calculate. For three and four fin configurations the minimum profile area is taken instead.\nBased on the results of models #4 and #5 it is clear that the aerodynamic drag coefficient (relative to the profile area) is significantly different for the body tube and fins. Thus we assume the drag to consist of two independent components, one for the fins and one for the body tube.\nAt terminal velocity the drag force is equal to that of gravity:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 (C_{D,f} A_f + C_{D,bt} A_{bt}) = mg \\quad (3.98)\n$$\nThe values for $C_{D,f}$ and $C_{D,bt}$ were varied to optimize the relative mean square error of the $v_0$ prediction, yielding a result of $C_{D,f} = 1.42$ and $C_{D,bt} = 0.56$. Using these values, the predicted terminal velocities varied between 3%...14% from the measured values.\nTable 3.4: Estimated fin efficiency factors for tumbling lower stages\nNumber of finsEfficiency factor\n10.50\n21.00\n31.50\n41.41\n51.81\n61.73\n71.90\n81.85\n\nDuring optimization it was noted that changing the error function being optimized had a significant effect on the resulting fin drag coefficient, but very little on the body tube drag coefficient. It is assumed that the fin tumbling model has greater inaccuracy in this aspect.\nIt is noteworthy that the body tube drag coefficient 0.56 is exactly half of that of a circular cylinder perpendicular to the airflow [15, p. 3-11]. This is expected of a cylinder that is falling at a random angle of attack. The fin drag coefficient 1.42 is also similar to that of a flat plate 1.17 or an open hemispherical cup 1.42 [15, p. 3-17].\nThe total drag coefficient $C_D$ of a tumbling lower stage is obtained by combining and scaling the two drag coefficient components:\n$$\nC_D = \\frac{C_{D,f} A_f + C_{D,bt} A_{bt}}{A_{ref}} \\quad (3.99)\n$$\nHere $A_{bt}$ is the profile area of the body, and $A_f$ the effective fin profile area, which is the area of a single fin multiplied by the efficiency factor. The estimated efficiency factors for various numbers of fins are listed in Table 3.4.\n\nChapter 4\nFlight simulation\nIn this chapter the actual flight simulation is analyzed. First in Section 4.1 methods for simulating atmospheric conditions and wind are presented. Then in Section 4.2 the actual simulation procedure is developed.\n4.1 Atmospheric properties\nIn order to calculate the aerodynamic forces acting on the rocket it is necessary to know the prevailing atmospheric conditions. Since the atmosphere is not constant with altitude, a model must be developed to account for the changes. Wind also plays an important role in the flight of a rocket, and therefore it is important to have a realistic wind model in use during the simulation.\n4.1.1 Atmospheric model\nThe atmospheric model is responsible for estimating the atmospheric conditions at varying altitudes. The properties that are of most interest are the density of air $\\rho$ (which is a scaling parameter to the aerodynamic coefficients via the dynamic pressure $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2$) and the speed of sound $c$ (which affects the Mach number of the rocket, which in turn affects its aerodynamic properties).\nThese may in turn be calculated from the air pressure $ p $ and temperature $ T $.\nSeveral models exist that define standard atmospheric conditions as a function of altitude, including the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) [27] and the U.S. Standard Atmosphere [28]. These two models yield identical temperature and pressure profiles for altitudes up to 32 km.\nThe models are based on the assumption that air follows the ideal gas law:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{Mp}{RT} \\quad (4.1)\n$$\nwhere $ M $ is the molecular mass of air and $ R $ is the ideal gas constant. From the equilibrium of hydrostatic forces, the differential equation for pressure as a function of altitude $ z $ can be found as\n$$\ndp = -g_0 \\rho_0 dz = -g_0 \\frac{Mp}{RT} dz \\quad (4.2)\n$$\nwhere $ g_0 $ is the gravitational acceleration. If the temperature of air were to be assumed to be constant, this would yield an exponential diminishing of air pressure.\nThe ISA and U.S. Standard Atmospheres further specify a standard temperature and pressure at sea level and a temperature profile for the atmosphere. The temperature profile is given as eight temperatures for different altitudes, which are then linearly interpolated. The temperature profile and base pressures for the ISA model are presented in Table 4.1. These values along with equation (4.2) define the temperature/pressure profile as a function of altitude.\nThese models are totally static and do not take into account any local flight conditions. Many rocketeers may be interested in flight differences during summer and winter and what kind of effect air pressure has on the flight. These are also parameters that can easily be measured on site when launching rockets. On the other hand, it is generally hard to know a specific temperature profile for a specific day. Therefore the atmospheric model was extended to allow the user to specify the base conditions either at mean sea level or at the altitude of the launch site. These values are simply assigned to the first layer of the atmospheric model. Most model rockets do not exceed altitudes of a few kilometers, and therefore the flight conditions at the launch site will dominate the flight.\nTable 4.1: Layers defined in the International Standard Atmosphere [29]\nLayerAltitude$^†$ mTemperature °CLapse rate °C/kmPressure Pa\n00+15.0−6.5101325\n111000−56.5+0.022632\n220000−56.5+1.05474.9\n332000−44.5+2.8868.02\n447000−2.5+0.0110.91\n551000−2.5−2.866.939\n671000−58.5−2.03.9564\n784852−86.20.3734\n\n$^†$ Altitude is the geopotential height which does not account for the diminution of gravity at high altitudes.\nOne parameter that also has an effect on air density and the speed of sound is humidity. The standard models do not include any definition of humidity as a function of altitude. Furthermore, the effect of humidity on air density and the speed of sound is marginal. The difference in air density and the speed of sound between completely dry air and saturated air at standard conditions are both less than 1%. Therefore the effect of humidity has been ignored.\n4.1.2 Wind modeling\nWind plays a critical role in the flight of model rockets. As has been seen, large angles of attack may cause rockets to lose a significant amount of stability and even go unstable. Over-stable rockets may weathercock and turn into the wind. In a perfectly static atmosphere a rocket would, in principle, fly its entire flight directly upwards at zero angle of attack. Therefore, the effect of wind must be taken into account in a full rocket simulation.\nMost model rocketeers, however, do not have access to a full wind profile of the area they are launching in. Different layers of air may have different wind velocities and directions. Modeling such complex patterns is beyond the scope of this project. Therefore, the goal is to produce a realistic wind model that can be specified with only a few parameters understandable tothe user and that covers altitudes of most rocket flights. Extensions to allow for multiple air layers may be added in the future.\nIn addition to a constant average velocity, wind always has some degree of turbulence in it. The effect of turbulence can be modeled by summing the steady flow of air and a random, zero-mean turbulence velocity. Two central aspects of the turbulence velocity are the amplitude of the variation and the frequencies at which they occur. Therefore a reasonable turbulence model is achieved by a random process that produces a sequence with a similar distribution and frequency spectrum as that of real wind.\nSeveral models of the spectrum of wind turbulence at specific altitudes exist. Two commonly used such spectra are the Kaimal and von Kármán wind turbulence spectra [30, p. 23]:\nKaimal:\n$$\n\\frac{S_u(f)}{\\sigma_u^2} = \\frac{4L_{1u}/U}{(1 + 6fL_{1u}/U)^{5/3}} \\quad (4.3)\n$$\nvon Kármán:\n$$\n\\frac{S_u(f)}{\\sigma_u^2} = \\frac{4L_{2u}/U}{(1 + 70.8(fL_{2u}/U)^2)^{5/6}} \\quad (4.4)\n$$\nHere $ S_u(f) $ is the spectral density function of the turbulence velocity and $ f $ the turbulence frequency, $ \\sigma_u $ the standard deviation of the turbulence velocity, $ L_{1u} $ and $ L_{2u} $ length parameters and $ U $ the average wind speed.\nBoth models approach the asymptotic limit $ S_u(f)/\\sigma_u^2 \\sim f^{-5/3} $ quite fast. Above frequencies of 0.5 Hz the difference between equation (4.3) and the same equation without the term 1 in the denominator is less than 4%. Since the time scale of a model rocket's flight is quite short, the effect of extremely low frequencies can be ignored. Therefore turbulence may reasonably well be modeled by utilizing pink noise that has a spectrum of $ 1/f^\\alpha $ with $ \\alpha = 5/3 $. True pink noise has the additional useful property of being scale-invariant. This means that a stream of pink noise samples may be generated and assumed to be at any sampling rate while maintaining their spectral properties.\nDiscreet samples of pink noise with spectrum $ 1/f^\\alpha $ can be generated by applying a suitable digital filter to white noise, which is simply uncorrelated pseudorandom numbers. One such filter is the infinite impulse response (IIR) filter presented by Kasdin [31]:\n$$\nx_n = w_n - a_1 x_{n-1} - a_2 x_{n-2} - a_3 x_{n-3} - \\ldots \\quad (4.5)\n$$\nwhere $ x_i $ are the generated samples, $ w_n $ is a generated white random number and the coefficients are computed using\n$$\na_0 = 1 \\\na_k = \\left( k - 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right) \\frac{a_{k-1}}{k}. \\quad (4.6)\n$$\nThe infinite sum may be truncated with a suitable number of terms. In the context of IIR filters these terms are called poles. Experimentation showed that already 1–3 poles provides a reasonably accurate frequency spectrum in the high frequency range.\nOne problem in using pink noise as a turbulence velocity model is that the power spectrum of pure pink noise goes to infinity at very low frequencies. This means that a long sequence of random values may deviate significantly from zero. However, when using the truncated IIR filter of equation (4.5), the spectrum density becomes constant below a certain limiting frequency, dependent on the number of poles used. By adjusting the number of poles used, the limiting frequency can be adjusted to a value suitable for model rocket flight. Specifically, the number of poles must be selected such that the limiting frequency is suitable at the chosen sampling rate.\nIt is also desirable that the simulation resolution does not affect the wind conditions. For example, a simulation with a time step of 10 ms should experience the same wind conditions as a simulation with a time step of 5 ms. This is achieved by selecting a constant turbulence generation frequency and interpolating between the generated points when necessary. The fixed frequency was chosen at 20 Hz, which can still simulate fluctuations at a time scale of 0.1 seconds.\nThe effect of the number of poles is depicted in Figure 4.1, where two pink noise sequences were generated from the same random number source with two-pole and ten-pole IIR filters. A small number of poles generates values strongly centered on zero, while a larger number of poles introduces more low frequency variability. Since the free-flight time of a typical model rocket is of the order of 5–30 seconds, it is desirable that the maximum gust length during the flight is substantially shorter than this. Therefore the pink noise generator used by the wind model was chosen to contain only two poles, which has a limiting frequency of approximately 0.3 Hz when sampled at 20 Hz. This means that gusts of wind longer than 3–5 seconds will be rare in the simulated turbulence, which is a suitable gust length for modeling typical model rocket flight. Figure 4.2 depicts the resulting pink noise spectrum of the two-pole IIR filter and the Kaimal spectrum of equation (4.3) scaled to match each other.\n\n\nTo simplify the model, the average wind speed is assumed to be constant with altitude and in a constant direction. This allows specifying the model parameters using just the average wind speed and its standard deviation. An alternative parameter for specifying the turbulence amplitude is the turbulence intensity, which is the percentage that the standard deviation is of the average wind velocity,\n$$\nI_u = \\frac{\\sigma_u}{U}. \\quad (4.7)\n$$\nWind farm load design standards typically specify turbulence intensities around 10...20% [30, p. 22]. It is assumed that these intensities are at the top of the range of conditions in which model rockets are typically flown.\nOverall, the process to generate the wind velocity as a function of time from the average wind velocity $ U $ and standard deviation $ \\sigma_u $ can be summarized in the following steps:\n\n\nGenerate a pink noise sample $ x_n $ from a Gaussian white noise sample $ w_n $ using equations (4.5) and (4.6) with two memory terms included.\n\n\nScale the sample to a standard deviation one. This is performed by dividing the value by a previously calculated standard deviation of a long, unscaled pink noise sequence (2.252 for the two-pole IIR filter).\n\n\nThe wind velocity at time $ n \\cdot \\Delta t $ ($ \\Delta t = 0.05 , \\text{s} $) is $ U_n = U + \\sigma_u x_n $. Velocities in between are interpolated.\n\n\n4.2 Modeling rocket flight\nModeling of rocket flight is based on Newton's laws. The basic forces acting upon a rocket are gravity, thrust from the motors and aerodynamic forces and moments. These forces and moments are calculated and integrated numerically to yield a simulation over a full flight.\nSince most model rockets fly at a maximum a few kilometers high, the curvature of the Earth is not taken into account. Assuming a flat Earth allowsus to use simple Cartesian coordinates to represent the position and altitude of the rocket. As a consequence, the Coriolis effect when flying long distances north or south is not simulated either.\n4.2.1 Coordinates and orientation\nDuring a rocket's flight, many quantities, such as the aerodynamical forces and thrust from the motors, are relative to the rocket itself, while others, such as the position and gravitational force, are more naturally described relative to the launch site. Therefore, two sets of coordinates are defined: the rocket coordinates, which are the same as used in Chapter 3, and world coordinates, which is a fixed coordinate system with the origin at the position of launch.\nThe position and velocity of a rocket are most naturally maintained as Cartesian world coordinates. Following normal conventions, the xy-plane is selected to be parallel to the ground and the z-axis is chosen to point upwards. In flight dynamics of aircraft, the z-axis often points towards the earth, but in the case of rockets it is natural to have the rocket's altitude as the z-coordinate.\nSince the wind is assumed to be unidirectional and the Coriolis effect is ignored, it may be assumed that the wind is directed along the x-axis. The angle of the launch rod may then be positioned relative to the direction of the wind without any loss of generality.\nDetermining the orientation of a rocket is more complicated. A natural choice for defining the orientation would be to use the spherical coordinate zenith and azimuth angles ($ \\theta, \\phi $) and an additional roll angle parameter. Another choice common in aviation is to use Euler angles [32]. However, both of these systems have notable shortcomings. Both systems have singularity points, in which the value of some parameter is ambiguous. With spherical coordinates, this is the direction of the z-axis, in which case the azimuth angle $ \\phi $ has no effect on the position. Rotations that occur near these points must often be handled as special cases. Furthermore, rotations in spherical coordinate systems contain complex trigonometric formulae which are prone to programming errors.\nThe solution to the singularity problem is to introduce an extra parameter and an additional constraint to the system. For example, the direction of a rocket could be defined by a three-dimensional unit vector $(x, y, z)$ instead of just the zenith and azimuth angles. The additional constraint is that the vector must be of unit length. This kind of representation has no singularity points which would require special consideration.\nFurthermore, Euler's rotation theorem states that a rigid body can be rotated from any orientation to any other orientation by a single rotation around a specific axis [33]. Therefore instead of defining quantities that define the orientation of the rocket we can define a three-dimensional rotation that rotates the rocket from a known reference orientation to the current orientation. This has the additional advantage that the same rotation and its inverse can be used to transform any vector between world coordinates and rocket coordinates.\nA simple and efficient way of describing the 3D rotation is by using unit quaternions. Each unit quaternion corresponds to a unique 3D rotation, and they are remarkably simple to combine and use. The following section will present a brief overview of the properties of quaternions.\nThe fixed reference orientation of the rocket defines the rocket pointing towards the positive z-axis in world coordinates and an arbitrary but fixed roll angle. The orientation of the rocket is then stored as a unit quaternion that rotates the rocket from this reference orientation to its current orientation. This rotation can also be used to transform vectors from world coordinates to rocket coordinates and its inverse from rocket coordinates to world coordinates. (Note that the rocket’s initial orientation on the launch pad may already be different than its reference orientation if the launch rod is not completely vertical.)\n4.2.2 Quaternions\nQuaternions are an extension of complex numbers into four dimensions. The usefulness of quaternions arises from their use in spatial rotations. Similar to the way multiplication with a complex number of unit length $ e^{i\\phi} $ corresponds to a rotation of angle $ \\phi $ around the origin on the complex plane, multiplication with unit quaternions correspond to specific 3D rotations around an axis. A more thorough review of quaternions and their use in spatial rotations is available in Wikipedia [34].\nThe typical notation of quaternions resembles the addition of a scalar and a vector:\n$$\nq = w + xi + yj + zk = w + \\mathbf{v} \\quad (4.8)\n$$\nAddition of quaternions and multiplication with a scalar operate as expected. However, the multiplication of two quaternions is non-commutative (in general $ ab \\neq ba $) and follows the rules\n$$\ni^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. \\quad (4.9)\n$$\nAs a corollary, the following equations hold:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nij &amp;= k &amp; ji &amp;= -k \\newline\\\njk &amp;= i &amp; kj &amp;= -i \\newline\\\nki &amp;= j &amp; ik &amp;= -j\n\\end{align*} \\quad (4.10)\n$$\nThe general multiplication of two quaternions becomes\n$$\n(a + bi + cj + dk)(w + xi + yj + zk) =\n\\begin{align*}\n&amp; (aw - bx - cy - dz) \\newline\\\n&amp; +(ax + bw + cz - dy) , i \\newline\\\n&amp; +(ay - bz + cw + dx) , j \\newline\\\n&amp; +(az + by - cx + dw) , k\n\\end{align*} \\quad (4.11)\n$$\nwhile the norm of a quaternion is defined in the normal manner\n$$\n|q| = \\sqrt{w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2}. \\quad (4.12)\n$$\nThe usefulness of quaternions becomes evident when we consider a rotation around a vector $\\mathbf{u}, |\\mathbf{u}| = 1$ by an angle $\\phi$. Let\n$$\nq = \\cos \\frac{\\phi}{2} + \\mathbf{u} \\sin \\frac{\\phi}{2}. \\quad (4.13)\n$$\nNow the previously mentioned rotation of a three-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{v}$ defined by $i, j, k$ is equivalent to the quaternion product\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\mapsto q \\mathbf{v} q^{-1}. \\quad (4.14)\n$$\nSimilarly, the inverse rotation is equivalent to the transformation\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\mapsto q^{-1} \\mathbf{v} q. \\quad (4.15)\n$$\nThe problem simplifies even further, since for unit quaternions\n$$\nq^{-1} = (w + xi + yj + zk)^{-1} = w - xi - yj - zk. \\quad (4.16)\n$$\nVectors can therefore be considered quaternions with no scalar component and their rotation is equivalent to the left- and right-sided multiplication with unit quaternions, requiring a total of 24 floating-point multiplications. Even if this does not make the rotations more efficient, it simplifies the trigonometry considerably and therefore helps reduce programming errors.\n4.2.3 Mass and moment of inertia calculations\nConverting the forces and moments into linear and angular acceleration requires knowledge of the rocket’s mass and moments of inertia. The mass of a component can be easily calculated from its volume and density. Due to the highly symmetrical nature of rockets, the rocket centerline is commonly a principal axis for the moments of inertia. Furthermore, the moments of inertia around the in the y- and z-axes are very close to one another. Therefore as a simplification only two moments of inertia are calculated, the longitudinal and rotational moment of inertia. These can be easily calculated for each component using standard formulae [35] and combined to yield the moments of the entire rocket.\nThis is a good way of calculating the mass, CG and inertia of a rocket during the design phase. However, actual rocket components often have a slightly different density or additional sources of mass such as glue attached to them. These cannot be effectively modeled by the simulator, since it would be extremely tedious to define all these properties. Instead, some properties of the components can be overridden to utilize measured values.\nTwo properties that can very easily be measured are the mass and CG position of a component. Measuring the moments of inertia is a much harder task. Therefore the moments of inertia are still computed automatically, but are scaled by the overridden measurement values.\nIf the mass of a component is overridden by a measured value, the moments of inertia are scaled linearly according to the mass. This assumes that the extra weight is distributed evenly along the component. If the CG position is overridden, there is no knowledge where the extra weight is at. Therefore as a best guess the moments of inertia are updated by shifting the moment axis according to the parallel axis theorem.\nAs the components are computed individually and then combined, the overriding can take place either for individual components or larger combinations. It is especially useful to override the mass and/or CG position of the entire rocket. This allows constructing a rocket from components whose masses are not precisely known and afterwards scaling the moments of inertia to closely match true values.\n4.2.4 Flight simulation\nThe process of simulating rocket flight can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n\nInitialize the rocket in a known position and orientation at time $ t = 0 $.\n\n\nCompute the local wind velocity and other atmospheric conditions.\n\n\nCompute the current airspeed, angle of attack, lateral wind direction, and other flight parameters.\n\n\nCompute the aerodynamic forces and moments affecting the rocket.\n\n\nCompute the effect of motor thrust and gravity.\n\n\nCompute the mass and moments of inertia of the rocket and from these the linear and rotational acceleration of the rocket.\n\n\nNumerically integrate the acceleration to the rocket’s position and orientation during a time step $\\Delta t$ and update the current time $ t \\mapsto t + \\Delta t $.\n\n\nSteps 1–6 are repeated until an end criteria is met, typically until the rocket has landed.\nThe computation of the atmospheric properties and instantaneous wind velocity were discussed in Section 4.1. The local wind velocity is added to the rocket velocity to get the airspeed velocity of the rocket. By inverse rotation this quantity is obtained in rocket coordinates, from which the angle of attack and other flight parameters can be computed.\nAfter the instantaneous flight parameters are known, the aerodynamic forces can be computed as discussed in Chapter 3. The computed forces are in the rocket coordinates, and can be converted to world coordinates by applying the orientation rotation. The thrust from the motors is similarly calculated from the thrust curves and converted to world coordinates, while the direction of gravity is already in world coordinates. When all of the forces and moments acting upon the rocket are known, the linear and rotational accelerations can be calculated using the mass and moments of inertia discussed in Section 4.2.3.\nThe numerical integration is performed using the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) integration method. In order to simulate the differential equations\n$$\nx''(t) = a(t) \\newline \\\n\\phi''(t) = \\alpha(t) \\quad (4.17)\n$$\nthe equation is first divided into first-order equations using the substitutions $ v(t) = x'(t) $ and $ \\omega(t) = \\phi'(t) $:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nv'(t) &amp;= a(t) \\newline \\\nx'(t) &amp;= v(t) \\newline \\\n\\omega'(t) &amp;= \\alpha(t) \\newline \\\n\\phi'(t) &amp;= \\omega(t)\n\\end{align*} \\quad (4.18)\n$$\nFor brevity, this is presented in the first-order representation\n$$\ny' = f(y, t) \\quad (4.19)\n$$\nwhere $ y $ is a vector function containing the position and orientation of the rocket.\nNext the right-hand side is evaluated at four positions, dependent on the previous evaluations:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nk_1 &amp;= f(y_0, t_0) \\newline \\\nk_2 &amp;= f\\left(y_0 + k_1 \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, t_0 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\newline \\\nk_3 &amp;= f\\left(y_0 + k_2 \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}, t_0 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\newline \\\nk_4 &amp;= f(y_0 + k_3 \\Delta t, t_0 + \\Delta t)\n\\end{align*} \\quad (4.20)\n$$\nFinally, the result is a weighted sum of these values:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ny_1 &amp;= y_0 + \\frac{1}{6} (k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) \\Delta t \\quad (4.21) \\newline \\\nt_1 &amp;= t_0 + \\Delta t \\quad (4.22)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nComputing the values $ k_1 \\ldots k_4 $ involves performing steps 1–5 four times per simulation iteration, but results in significantly better simulation precision. The method is a fourth-order integration method, meaning that the error incurred during one simulation step is of the order $ O(\\Delta t^5) $ and of the total simulation $ O(\\Delta t^4) $. This is a considerable improvement over, for example, simple Euler integration, which has a total error of the order $ O(\\Delta t) $. Halvingthe time step in an Euler integration only halves the total error, but reduces the error of a RK4 simulation 16-fold.\nThe example above used a total rotation vector $\\phi$ to contain the orientation of the rocket. Instead, this is replaced by the rotation quaternion, which can be utilized directly as a transformation between world and rocket coordinates. Instead of updating the total rotation vector,\n$$\n\\phi_1 = \\phi_0 + \\omega \\Delta t, \\quad (4.23)\n$$\nthe orientation quaternion $o$ is updated by the same amount by\n$$\no_1 = \\left( \\cos (|\\omega| \\Delta t) + \\hat{\\omega} \\sin (|\\omega| \\Delta t) \\right) \\cdot o_0. \\quad (4.24)\n$$\nThe first term is simply the unit quaternion corresponding to the 3D rotation $\\omega \\Delta t$ as in equation (4.13). It is applied to the previous value $o_0$ by multiplying the quaternion from the left. This update is performed both during the calculation of $k_2 \\ldots k_4$ and when computing the final step result. Finally, in order to improve numerical stability, the quaternion is normalized to unit length.\nSince most of a rocket’s flight occurs in a straight line, rather large time steps can be utilized. However, the rocket may encounter occasional oscillation, which may affect its flight notably. Therefore the time step utilized is dynamically reduced in cases where the angular velocity or angular acceleration exceeds a predefined limit. This allows utilizing reasonably large time steps for most of the flight, while maintaining the accuracy during oscillation.\n4.2.5 Recovery simulation\nAll model rockets must have some recovery system for safe landing. This is typically done either using a parachute or a streamer. When a parachute is deployed the rocket typically splits in half, and it is no longer practical to compute the orientation of the rocket. Therefore at this point the simulation changes to a simpler, three degree of freedom simulation, where only the position of the rocket is computed.\nThe entire drag coefficient of the rocket is assumed to come from the deployed recovery devices. For parachutes the drag coefficient is by default 0.8 [15, p. 13-23] with the reference area being the area of the parachute. The user can also define their own drag coefficient.\nThe drag coefficient of streamers depends on the material, width, and length of the streamer. The drag coefficient and optimization of streamers has been an item of much interest within the rocketry community, with competitions being held on streamer descent time durations [46]. In order to estimate the drag coefficient of streamers, a series of experiments were performed using the 40 × 40 × 120 cm wind tunnel of Pollux [36]. The experiments were performed using various materials, widths, and lengths of streamers and at different wind speeds. From these results, an empirical formula was devised that estimates the drag coefficient of streamers. The experimental results and the derivation of the empirical formula are presented in Appendix C. Validation performed with an independent set of measurements indicates that the drag coefficient is estimated with an accuracy of about 20%, which translates to a descent velocity accuracy within 15% of the true value.\n4.2.6 Simulation events\nNumerous different events may cause actions to be taken during a rocket’s flight. For example, in high-power rockets the burnout or ignition charge of the first stage’s motor may trigger the ignition of a second stage motor. Similarly, a flight computer may deploy a small drogue parachute when apogee is detected and the main parachute is deployed later at a predefined lower altitude. To accommodate different configurations, a simulation event system is used, where events may cause other events to be triggered.\nTable 4.2 lists the available simulation events and which of them can be used to trigger motor ignition or recovery device deployment. Each trigger event may additionally include a delay time. For example, one motor may be configured to ignite at launch and a second motor to ignite using a timer at 5 seconds after launch. Alternatively, a short delay of 0.5–1 seconds may be used to simulate the delay of an ejection charge igniting the upper stage motors.\nThe flight events are also stored along with the simulated flight data for later analysis. They are also available to the simulation listeners, described in Section 5.1.3, to act upon specific conditions.\nTable 4.2: Simulation events and the actions they may trigger (motor ignition or recovery device deployment).\nEvent descriptionTriggers\nRocket launch at $ t = 0 $Ignition, recovery\nMotor ignitionNone\nMotor burnoutIgnition\nMotor ejection chargeIgnition, recovery\nLaunch rod clearedNone\nApogee detectedRecovery\nChange in altitudeRecovery\nTouchdown after flightNone\nDeployment of a recovery deviceNone\nEnd of simulationNone\n\n\nChapter 5\nThe OpenRocket simulation software\nThe flight simulation described in the previous chapters was implemented in the OpenRocket simulation software [7]. The software was written entirely in Java for maximum portability between different operating systems. A significant amount of effort was put into making the graphical user interface (UI) robust, intuitive, and easy to use. As of the first public release, the source code contained over 300 classes and over 47,000 lines of code (including comments and blank lines).\nThe software was released under the copyleft GNU General Public License (GPL) [37], allowing everybody access to the source code and permitting use and modification for any purposes. The only major restriction placed is that if a modified version is distributed, the source code for the modifications must also be available under the GNU GPL. This ensures that the program stays free and Open Source; a company cannot simply take the code, enhance it and start selling it as their own without contributing anything back to the community.\nIn this section the basic architectural designs are discussed and the main features of the UI are explained.\n5.1 Architectural design\nThe software has been split into various components within their own Java packages. This enables use of the components without needing the other components. For example, all of the UI code is within the gui package, and the simulation system can be used independently of it.\nThe rocket structure is composed of components, each with their own class defined within the package rocketcomponent. This provides the base for defining a rocket. The components are described in more detail in Section 5.1.1. The simulation code is separated from the aerodynamic calculation code in the simulation and aerodynamics packages, respectively; these are discussed in Section 5.1.2.\nThe package naming convention recommended in the Java Language Specification is followed [38]. Therefore all package names discussed herein are relative to the package net.sf.openrocket. For example, the rocket components are defined in the package net.sf.openrocket.rocketcomponent.\n5.1.1 Rocket components\nThe structure of the rocket is split up into components, for example nose cones, body tubes and components within the rocket body. Each component type is defined as a subclass of the abstract RocketComponent class. Each component can contain zero or more components attached to it, which creates a tree structure containing the entire rocket design. The base component of every design is a Rocket object, which holds one or more Stage objects. These represent the stages of the rocket and hold all of the physical components.\nInheritance has been highly used in the class hierarchy of the components in order to combine common features of various components. There are also some abstract classes, such as BodyComponent, whose sole purpose currently is to allow future extensions. The complete component class hierarchy is presented as a UML diagram in Figure 5.1, and a more detailed description of each class is presented in Table 5.1.\nAdditionally, four interfaces are defined for the components, MotorMount,\n\n\nTable 5.1: Descriptions of the rocket component classes and their functionality. Abstract classes are shown in italics.\nComponent classDescription\nRocketComponent:The base class of all components, including common features such as child component handling.\nRocket:The base component of a rocket design, provides change event notifications.\nComponentAssembly:A base component for an assembly of external components. This could in the future be extended to allow multiple rocket bodies next to each other.\nStage:A separable stage of the rocket.\nExternalComponent:An external component that has an effect on the aerodynamics of the rocket.\nBodyComponent:A portion of the main rocket body, defined in cylindrical coordinates by $ r = f(x, \\theta) $.\nSymmetricComponent:An axisymmetrical body component.\nTransition:A symmetrical transition (shoulder or boattail).\nNoseCone:A transition with the initial radius zero.\nBodyTube:A cylindrical body tube. Can be used as a motor mount.\nFinSet:A set of one or more fins.\nTrapezoidalFinSet:A set of trapezoidal fins.\nEllipticalFinSet:A set of elliptical fins.\nFreeformFinSet:A set of free-form fins.\nLaunchLug:A launch lug or rail pin.\nInternalComponent:An internal component that may affect the mass of the rocket but not its aerodynamics.\nStructuralComponent:A structural internal component, with specific shape and density.\nRingComponent:A hollow cylindrical component.\nThicknessRingComponent:A component defined by an outer radius and shell thickness.\nInnerTube:An inner tube. Can be used as a motor mount and can be clustered.\nTubeCoupler:A coupler tube.\nEngineBlock:An engine block.\nRadiusRingComponent:A component defined by an inner and outer radius.\nCenteringRing:A ring for centering components.\nBulkhead:A solid bulkhead (inner radius zero).\nMassObject:An internal component shaped approximately like a solid cylinder and with a specific mass.\nMassComponent:A generic component with specific mass, for example payload.\nRecoveryDevice:A recovery device.\nParachute:A parachute.\nStreamer:A streamer.\nShockCord:A shock cord with a specified material and length.\n\nClusterable, RadialParent and Coaxial. Components implementing the MotorMount interface, currently BodyTube and InnerTube, can function as motor mounts and have motors loaded in them. The Clusterable interface signifies that the component can be clustered in various configurations. Currently only the InnerTube component can be clustered. Components and motors that are attached to a clustered inner tube are automatically replicated to all tubes within the cluster. The RadialParent interface allows inner components to automatically identify their correct inner and outer radii based on their parent and sibling components. For example, a coupler tube can automatically detect its radius based on the inner radius of the parent body tube. Coaxial on the other hand provides a generic interface for accessing and modifying properties of fixed-radius components.\nSince the software functionality is divided into different packages, all component similarities cannot be directly exploited through inheritance. For example, the method of drawing a nose cone shape belongs to the gui.rocketfigure package, however, it can share the same code that draws a transition. For these purposes, reflective programming is used extensively. The code for drawing both nose cones and transitions is provided in the class gui.rocketfigure.SymmetricComponentShapes, while the simpler body tube is drawn by the class BodyTubeShapes. The correct class is derived and instantiated dynamically based on the component class. This allows easily sharing functionality common to different components while still having loose coupling between the rocket structure, presentation, computation and storage methods.\n5.1.2 Aerodynamic calculators and simulators\nOne of the key aspects in the design of the simulation implementation was extensibility. Therefore all aerodynamic calculation code is separated in the package aerodynamics and all simulation code is in the package simulator. This allows adding new implementations of the aerodynamic calculators and simulators independently. For example, a simulator using Euler integration was written in the early stages of development, and later replaced by the Runge-Kutta 4 simulator. Similarly, a different method of calculating the aerodynamic forces, such as CFD, could be implemented and used by the existing simulators.\nThe basis for all aerodynamic calculations is the interface Aerodynamic.\nCalculator. The current implementation, based on the Barrowman methods, is implemented in the class BarrowmanCalculator. This implementation caches mid-results for performance reasons.\nFlight simulation is split into the interfaces SimulationEngine, which is responsible for maintaining the flow of the simulation and handling events (such as motor ignition), and SimulationStepper, which is responsible for taking individual time steps while simulating (using e.g. RK4 iteration).\nSimilar abstraction has been performed for the atmospheric temperature and pressure model with the AtmosphericModel interface, the gravity model with GravityModel, the wind modelling with WindModel and different rocket motor types by the Motor class, among others.\n5.1.3 Simulation listeners\nSimulation listeners are pieces of code that can dynamically be configured to listen to and interact with a simulation while it is running. The listeners are called before and after each simulation step, each simulation event and any calculations performed during flight simulation. The listeners may simply gather flight data for use outside the simulation or modify the rocket or simulation during the flight. This allows great potential for extensibility both internally and externally.\nListeners are used internally for various purposes such as retrieving flight progress information when the user is running simulations and cancelling the simulations when necessary. Implementing such functionality otherwise would have required a lot of special case handling directly within the simulation code.\nListeners can also be used to modify the simulation or the rocket during its flight. The successor project of Haisunäättä included an active roll stabilization system, where a flight computer measured the roll rate using two magnetometers and used a PID controller to adjust two auxiliary fins to cancel out any roll produced by inevitable imperfections in the main fins. A simulation listener was written that initially simulated the PID controller purely in Java, which modified the cant angle of the auxiliary fins during the simulation. Later, a similar listener interfaced the external flight computer directly using a serial data link. The listener fed the simulated flight data to the controller which computed and reported the control actions back to the simulator. This system helped identify and fix numerous bugs in the flight computer software, which would have otherwise been nearly impossible to fully test. It is expected that the simulation listeners will be an invaluable tool for more ambitious model rocket enthusiasts.\nA listener is produced by implementing the SimulationListener and optionally SimulationEventListener and SimulationComputationListener interfaces, or by extending the AbstractSimulationListener class. The UI includes the option of defining custom simulation listeners to be utilized during flight simulation.\n5.1.4 Warnings\nThe aerodynamic calculations and simulations are based on certain assumptions and simplifications, such as a low angle of attack and a smooth, continuous rocket body. The rocket component architecture makes it possible to create designs that break these assumptions. Instead of limiting the options of the design, the aerodynamic calculator and simulator can produce warnings about such issues. These warnings are presented to the user during the design of the rocket or after simulations. It is then left up to the user to judge whether such violations are significant enough to cast doubt to the validity of the results.\n5.1.5 File format\nAn XML-based file format was devised for storing the rocket designs and simulations. The use of XML allows using many existing tools for reading and writing the files, allows easy extensibility and makes the files human-readable. The user has the option of including all simulated data in the file, storing the data at specific time intervals or storing only the simulation launch conditions. To reduce the file size, the files can additionally be compressed using the standard GZIP compression algorithm [39]. The files are compressed and uncompressed automatically by the software. The file extension .ORK was chosen for the design files, an abbreviation of the software name that at the same time had no previous uses as a file extension.\n5.2 User interface design\nThe user interface was designed with the intent of being robust but yet easy to use even for inexperienced users. The main window, depicted in Figure 5.2(a) with the design of the original Haisunäättä rocket, consists of a schematic drawing of the rocket, the tree structure of the rocket components and buttons for adding new components to the structure. Components can be selected or edited by clicking and double-clicking either the tree view or the component in the schematic diagram. The selected components are drawn in bold to give a visual clue to the position of the component.\nThe schematic drawing can be viewed either from the side or from the rear, can be zoomed in and out and rotated along the centerline. The schematic diagram view also presents basic information about the rocket, such as the design name, length, maximum diameter, mass and possible warnings about the design. It also calculates the CG and CP positions continuously during design and shows them both numerically and on the diagram. Additionally, a simulation is automatically run in the background after each modification and the main results are presented in the lower left corner of the diagram. Many users are interested in the maximum altitude or velocity of the rocket, and this allows an immediate feedback on the effect of the changes they are making to the design. The flight information typically takes less than a second to update.\nThe upper part of the main window can also be changed to view simulation results, Figure 5.2(b). Many simulations can be added with different launch conditions and motor configurations to investigate their effects. Each simulation has a row which presents the basic information about the simulation. The first column gives an immediate visual clue to the status of the simulation; a gray ball indicates that the simulation has not been run yet, green indicates an up-to-date simulation, red indicates that the design has been changed after the simulation was run and yellow indicates that the simulation information was loaded from a file, but that the file states it to be up-to-date. The simulations can be run one or several at a time. The software automatically utilizes several threads when running multiple simulations on a multi-CPU computer to utilize the full processing capacity.\nFigure 5.3 shows two dialogs that are used to modify and analyze the designs. The components are edited using a small dialog window that allows the user to either fill in the exact numerical values specifying the shape of the component or use sliders to modify them. The user can change the units by clicking on them, or set default values from the preferences. Different tabs allow control over the mass and CG override settings, figure color options, motor mount and cluster options and more. The Component analysis dialog shown in the figure can be used to analyze the effect of individual components on the total stability, drag and roll characteristics of the rocket.\nSimilarly, the launch conditions and simulator options can be edited in the corresponding dialog. The simulator options also allow the user to define custom simulation listeners to use during the simulations. The simulation edit dialog is also used for later data analysis. The simulated data can be plotted in a variety of ways as shown in Figure 5.4. The user can use predefined plot settings or define their own. Up to 15 different variables out of the 47 quantities computed can be plotted at a time. The variable on the horizontal axis can be freely selected, and the other variables can be plotted on one of two vertical axes, on either side of the plot. The user can either specify whether a variable should plot on the left or right axis or let the software decide the most suitable axis. Typical plots include the altitude, vertical velocity and acceleration of the rocket with time or the drag coefficient as a function of the Mach number.\nAdvanced users may also export the flight data in CSV format for further analysis using other tools.\n\nChapter 6\nComparison with experimental data\nIn order to validate the results produced by the software, several test flights were made and compared to the results simulated by the software. In addition to the software produced, the same simulations were performed in the current de facto standard model rocket simulator RockSim [5]. The software used was the free demonstration version of RockSim version 8.0.1f9. This is the latest demo version of the software available at the time of writing. The RockSim site states that the demo version is totally equivalent to the normal version except that it can only be used a limited time and it does not simulate the rocket’s descent after apogee.\nComparisons were performed using both a typical model rocket design, presented in Section 6.1, and a large hybrid rocket, Section 6.2. A small model with canted fins was also constructed and flown to test the roll simulation, presented in Section 6.3. Finally in Section 6.4 some of the the aerodynamic properties calculated by the software are compared to actual measurements performed in a wind tunnel.\n6.1 Comparison with a small model rocket\nFor purposes of gathering experimental flight data, a small model rocket representing the size and characteristics of a typical model rocket was constructed and flown in various configurations. The rocket model was 56 cm long with a body diameter of 29 mm. The nose cone was a 10 cm long tangent ogive, and the fins simple trapezoidal fins. The entire rocket was painted using an airbrush but not finished otherwise and the fin profiles were left rectangular, so as to represent a typical non-competition model rocket. The velocity of the rocket remained below 0.2 Mach during the entire flight.\nIn the payload section of the rocket was included an Alt15K/WD Rev2 altimeter from PerfectFlite [40]. The altimeter measures the altitude of the rocket based on atmospheric pressure changes ten times per second. The manufacturer states the accuracy of the altimeter to be ±(0.25% + 0.6 m). The altimeter logs the flight data, which can later be retrieved to a computer for further analysis.\nFour holes, each 1 mm in diameter were drilled evenly around the payload body to allow the ambient air pressure to reach the pressure sensor, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The rocket was launched from a 1 m high tower launcher, which removed the need for any launch lugs. Figure 6.1 presents a picture of the test rocket and the tower launcher.\nA design of the same rocket was created in both OpenRocket and RockSim. During construction of the rocket each component was individually weighed and the weight of the corresponding component was overridden in the software for maximum accuracy. Finally, the mass and CG position of the entire rocket was overridden with measured values.\nOne aspect of the rocket that could not be measured was the average surface roughness. In the OpenRocket design the “regular paint” finish was selected, which corresponds to an average surface roughness of 60 μm. From the available options of “polished”, “gloss”, “matt” and “unfinished” in RockSim, the “matt” option was estimated to best describe the rocket; the corresponding average surface roughness is unknown.\nThe rocket was flown using motors manufactured by WECO Feuerwerk (previously Sachsen Feuerwerk) [41], which correspond largely to the motors produced by Estes [42]. The only source available for the thrust curves of Sachsen\n\nTable 6.1: Apogee altitude of simulated and experimental flights with B4-4 and C6-3 motors.\nB4-4C6-3\nExperimental64.0 m151.5 m\nOpenRocket74.4 m  +16%161.4 m  +7%\nRockSim79.1 m  +24%180.1 m  +19%\n\nFeuerwerk motors was a German rocketry store [43], the original source of the measurements are unknown. The thrust curve for the C6-3 motor is quite similar to the corresponding Estes motor, and has a total impulse of 7.5 Ns. However, the thrust curve for the B4-4 motor yields a total impulse of 5.3 Ns, which would make it a C-class motor, while the corresponding Estes motor has an impulse of only 4.3 Ns. Both OpenRocket and RockSim simulated the flight of the rocket using the SF B4-4 motor over 60% higher than the apogee of the experimental results. It is likely that the thrust curve of the SF B4-4 is wrong, and therefore the Estes B4-4 motor was used in the simulations in its stead.\nFigure 6.2 shows the experimental and simulated results for the flight using a B4-4 motor (simulations using an Estes motor) and figure 6.3 using a C6-3 motor. The RockSim simulations are truncated at apogee due to limitations of the demonstration version of the software. A summary of the apogee altitudes is presented in Table 6.1.\nBoth simulations produce a bit too optimistic results. OpenRocket yielded altitudes 16% and 7% too high for the B4-4 and C6-3 motors, respectively, while RockSim had errors of 24% and 19%. The C6-3 flight is considered to be more accurate due to the ambiguity of the B4-4 thrust curve. Another feature that can be seen from the graphs is that the estimated descent speed of the rocket is quite close to the actual descent speed. The error in the descent speeds are 7% and 13% respectively.\nThe rocket was also launched with a launch lug 24 mm long and 5 mm in diameter attached first to its mid-body and then next to its fins to test the effect of a launch lug on the aerodynamic drag. The apogee altitudes of the tests were 147.2 m and 149.0 m, which correspond to an altitude reduction of 2–3%. The OpenRocket simulation with such a launch lug yielded results approximately 1.3% less than without the launch lug.\n\n\n\n6.2 Comparison with a hybrid rocket\nThe second comparison is with the Haisunäättä hybrid rocket [12], which was launched in September 2008. The rocket is a HyperLOC 835 model, with a length of 198 cm and a body diameter of 10.2 cm. The nose cone is a tangent ogive with a length of 34 cm, and the kit includes three approximately trapezoidal fins.\nThe flight computer on board was a miniAlt/WD altimeter by PerfectFlite [40], with a stated accuracy of ±0.5%. The flight computer calculates the altitude 20 times per second based on the atmospheric pressure and stores the data into memory for later analysis.\nThe rocket was modeled as accurately as possible with both OpenRocket and RockSim, but the mass and CG of each component was computed by the software. Finally, the mass of the entire rocket excluding the motor was overridden by the measured mass of the rocket. The surface roughness was estimated as the same as for the small rocket, 60 μm in OpenRocket and “matt” for RockSim.\nFigure 6.4 presents the true flight profile and that of the simulations. Both OpenRocket and RockSim estimate a too low apogee altitude, with an error of 16% and 12%, respectively. As in the case of the small rocket model, RockSim produces an estimate 5–10% higher than OpenRocket. It remains unclear which software is more accurate in its estimates.\nOne error factor also affecting this comparison is the use of a hybrid rocket motor. As noted in Section 2.2, the vapor pressure of the nitrous oxide is highly dependent on temperature, which affects the thrust of the motor. This may cause some variation in the thrust between true flight and motor tests.\n6.3 Comparison with a rolling rocket\nIn order to test the rolling moment computation, a second configuration of the small model rocket, described in Section 6.1, was built with canted fins. The design was identical to the previous one, but each fin was canted by an angle of 5°. In addition, the payload section contained a magnetometer logger, built by Antti J. Niskanen, that measured the roll rate of the rocket. The logger used two Honeywell HMC1051 magnetometer sensors to measure the Earth’s magnetic field and store the values at a rate of 100 Hz for later analysis. The rocket was launched from the tower launcher using a Sachsen Feuerwerk C6-3 motor. Further test flights were not possible since the lower rocket part was destroyed by a catastrophic motor failure on the second launch.\n\n\nAfter the flight, a spectrogram of the magnetometer data was generated by dividing the data into largely overlapping segments of 0.4 seconds each, windowed by a Hamming window, and computing the Fourier transform of these segments. For each segment the frequency with the largest power density was chosen as the roll frequency at the midpoint of the segment in time. The resulting roll frequency as a function of time is plotted in Figure 6.5 with the corresponding simulated roll frequency.\nThe simulated roll rate differs significantly from the experimental roll rate. During the flight the rocket peaked at a roll rate of 16 revolutions per second, while the simulation has only about half of this. The reason for the discrepancy is unknown and would need more data to analyze. However, after the test flight it was noticed that the cardboard fins of the test rocket were slightly curved, which may have a significant effect on the roll rate. A more precise test rocket with more rigid and straight fins would be needed for a more definitive comparison. Still, even at a cant angle of 7° the simulation produces a roll rate of only 12 r/s.\nEven so, it is believed that including roll in the simulation allows users to realistically analyze the effect of roll stabilization for example in windy conditions.\n6.4 Comparison with wind tunnel data\nFinally, the simulated results were compared with experimental wind tunnel data. The model that was analyzed by J. Ferris in the transonic region [22] and by C. Babb and D. Fuller in the supersonic region [44] is representative of the Arcas Robin meteorological rocket that has been used in high-altitude research activities. The model is 104.1 cm long with a body diameter of 5.72 cm. It includes a 27 cm long tangent ogive nose cone and a 4.6 cm long conical boattail at the rear end, which reduces the diameter to 3.7 cm. The rocket includes four trapezoidal fins, the profiles of which are double-wedges. For details of the configuration, refer to [22].\n\nThe design was replicated in OpenRocket as closely as possible, given the current limitations of the software. The most notable difference is that an airfoil profile was selected for the fins instead of the double-wedge that is not supported by OpenRocket. The aerodynamical properties were computed at the same Mach and Reynolds numbers as the experimental data.\nThe most important variables a ecting the altitude reached by a rocket are the drag coefficient and CP location. The experimental and simulated axial drag coefficient at zero angle-of-attack is presented in Figure 6.6. The general shape of the simulated drag coefficient follows the experimental results. However, a few aspects of the rocket break the assumptions made in the computation methods. First, the boattail at the end of the rocket reduces the drag by guiding the air into the void left behind it, while the simulation software only takes into account the reduction of base area. Second, the airfoil shape of the  ns a ects the drag characteristic especially in the transonic region, where it produces the slight reduction peak. Finally, at higher supersonic speeds the simulation produces less reliable results as expected, producing a too high drag coefficient. Overall, however, the drag coefficient matches the experimental results with reasonable accuracy, and the results of actual test flights shown in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 give credence to the drag coefficient estimation.\nThe CP location as a function of Mach number and the normal force coefficient derivative $C_{Na}$ are presented in Figure 6.7. The 3% error margins in the transonic region were added due to difficulty in estimating the normal force and pitch moment coefficient derivatives from the printed graphs; in the supersonic region the CP location was provided directly. At subsonic speeds the CP location matches the experimental results to within a few percent. At higher supersonic speeds the estimate is too pessimistic, and due to the interpolation this is visible also in the transonic region. However, the CP location is quite reasonable up to about Mach 1.5.\nThe simulated normal force coefficient derivative is notably lower than the experimental values. The reason for this is unknown, since in his thesis Barrowman obtained results accurate to about 6%. The effect of the lower normal force coefficient on a flight simulation is that the rocket corrects its orientation slightly slower than in reality. The effect on the flight altitude is considered to be small for typical stable rockets.\n\n\n\nChapter 7\nConclusion\nModel rocketry is an intriguing sport which combines various fields ranging from aerodynamic design to model construction to pyrotechnics. At its best, it works as an inspiration for youngsters to study engineering and sciences.\nThis thesis work provides one of the computer-age tools for everybody interested in model rocket design. Providing everybody free access to a full-fledged rocket simulator allows many more hobbyists to experiment with different kinds of rocket designs and become more involved in the sport. The most enthusiastic rocketeers may dive even deeper and get to examine not only the simulation results, but also how those simulations are actually performed.\nThe software produced contains an easy-to-use interface, which allows new users to start experimenting with the minimum effort. The back-end is designed to be easily extensible, in anticipation of future enhancements. This thesis also includes a step-by-step process for computing the aerodynamical characteristics of a rocket and for simulating its flight. These are the current default implementations used by the software.\nComparison to experimental data shows that the most important aerodynamical parameters for flight simulation—the center of pressure location and drag coefficient—are simulated with an accuracy of approximately 10% at subsonic velocities. In this velocity regime the accuracy of the simulated altitude is on par with the commercial simulation software RockSim. While comparison with supersonic rockets was not possible, it is expected that the simulation is reasonably accurate to at least Mach 1.5.\nThe six degree of freedom simulator also allows simulating rocket roll in order to study the effect of roll stabilization, a feature not available in other hobby-level rocket simulators. While the comparison with experimental data of a rolling rocket was inconclusive as to its accuracy, it is still expected to give valuable insight into the effects of roll during flight.\nThe external listener classes that can be attached to the simulator allow huge potential for custom extensions. For example, testing the active roll reduction controller that will be included in the successor project of Haisunäättä would have been exceedingly difficult without such support. By interfacing the actual controller with a simulated flight environment it was possible to discover various bugs in the controller software that would otherwise have gone undetected.\nFinally, it must be emphasized that the release of the OpenRocket software is not the end of this project. In line with the Open Source philosophy, it is just the beginning of its development cycle, where anybody with the know-how can contribute to making OpenRocket an even better simulation environment.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to express my deepest gratitude to M.Sc.

In this appendix the most common shapes and their defining parameters are presented.\nA.1 Conical\nThe most simple nose cone shape is a right circular cone. They are easy to make from a round piece of cardboard. A conical nose cone is defined simply by its length and base diameter. An additional parameter is the opening angle $\\phi$, shown in Figure A.1(a). The defining equation of a conical nose cone is\n$$\nr(x) = \\frac{x}{L} \\cdot R. \\quad (A.1)\n$$\nA.2 Ogival\nOgive nose cones have a profile which is an arc of a circle, as shown in Figure A.1(b). The most common ogive shape is the tangent ogive nose cone, which is formed when the radius of curvature of the circle $\\rho_t$ is selected such that the joint between the nose cone and body tube is smooth,\n$$\n\\rho_t = \\frac{R^2 + L^2}{2R}. \\quad (A.2)\n$$\nIf the radius of curvature $\\rho$ is greater than this, then the resulting nose cone has an angle at the joint between the nose cone and body tube, and is called a secant ogive. The secant ogives can also be viewed as a larger tangent ogive with its base cropped. At the limit $\\rho \\to \\infty$ the secant ogive becomes a conical nose cone.\nThe parameter value $\\kappa$ used for ogive nose cones is the ratio of the radius of curvature of a corresponding tangent ogive $\\rho_t$ to the radius of curvature of the nose cone $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\rho_t}{\\rho} \\quad (A.3)\n$$\n$\\kappa$ takes values from zero to one, where $\\kappa = 1$ produces a tangent ogive and $\\kappa = 0$ produces a conical nose cone (infinite radius of curvature).\nWith a given length $L$, radius $R$ and parameter $\\kappa$ the radius of curvature is computed by\n$$\n\\rho^2 = \\frac{(L^2 + R^2) \\cdot (( (2 - \\kappa) L )^2 + (\\kappa R)^2)}{4 (\\kappa R)^2}. \\quad (A.4)\n$$\nUsing this the radius at position $x$ can be computed as\n$$\nr(x) = \\sqrt{\\rho^2 - (L/\\kappa - x)^2} - \\sqrt{\\rho^2 - (L/\\kappa)^2} \\quad (A.5)\n$$\nA.3 Elliptical\nElliptical nose cones have the shape of an ellipsoid with one major radius is $L$ and the other two $R$. The profile has a shape of a half-ellipse with major axis $L$ and $R$, Figure A.1(c). It is a simple geometric shape common in model rocketry. The special case $R = L$ corresponds to a half-sphere.\nThe equation for an elliptical nose cone is obtained by stretching the equation of a unit circle:\n$$\nr(x) = R \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)^2} \\quad (A.6)\n$$\nA.4 Parabolic series\nA parabolic nose cone is the shape generated by rotating a section of a parabola around a line perpendicular to its symmetry axis, Figure A.1(d). This is distinct from a paraboloid, which is rotated around this symmetry axis (see Appendix A.5).\nSimilar to secant ogives, the base of a “full” parabolic nose cone can be cropped to produce nose cones which are not tangent with the body tube. The parameter $\\kappa$ describes the portion of the larger nose cone to include, with values ranging from zero to one. The most common values are $\\kappa = 0$ for a conical nose cone, $\\kappa = 0.5$ for a 1/2 parabola, $\\kappa = 0.75$ for a 3/4 parabola and $\\kappa = 1$ for a full parabola. The equation of the shape is\n$$\nr(x) = R \\cdot \\frac{x}{L} \\left(\\frac{2 - \\kappa \\frac{x}{L}}{2 - \\kappa}\\right). \\quad (A.7)\n$$\nA.5 Power series\nThe power series nose cones are generated by rotating the segment\n$$\nr(x) = R \\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^{\\kappa} \\quad (A.8)\n$$\naround the x-axis, Figure A.1(e). The parameter value $\\kappa$ can range from zero to one. Special cases are $\\kappa = 1$ for a conical nose cone, $\\kappa = 0.75$ for a 3/4 power nose cone and $\\kappa = 0.5$ for a 1/2 power nose cone or an ellipsoid. The limit $\\kappa \\to 0$ forms a blunt cylinder.\nA.6 Haack series\nIn contrast to the other shapes which are formed from rotating geometric shapes or simple formulae around an axis, the Haack series nose cones are mathematically derived to minimize the theoretical pressure drag. Even though they are defined as a series, two specific shapes are primarily used, the LV-Haack shape and the LD-Haack or Von Kármán shape. The letters\nLV and LD refer to length-volume and length-diameter, and they minimize the theoretical pressure drag of the nose cone for a specific length and volume or length and diameter, respectively. Since the parameters defining the dimensions of the nose cone are its length and radius, the Von Kármán nose cone (Figure A.1(f)) should, in principle, be the optimal nose cone shape.\nThe equation for the series is\n$$\nr(x) = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\sqrt{\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2\\theta) + \\kappa \\sin^3 \\theta} \\quad (A.9)\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\theta = \\cos^{-1} \\left(1 - \\frac{2x}{L}\\right). \\quad (A.10)\n$$\nThe parameter value $\\kappa = 0$ produces the Von Kármán or LD-Haack shape and $\\kappa = 1/3$ produces the LV-Haack shape. In principle, values of $\\kappa$ up to 2/3 produce monotonic nose cone shapes. However, since there is no experimental data available for the estimation of nose cone pressure drag for $\\kappa &gt; 1/3$ (see Appendix B.3), the selection of the parameter value is limited in the software to the range 0...1/3.\nA.7 Transitions\nThe vast majority of all model rocket transitions are conical. However, all of the nose cone shapes may be adapted as transition shapes as well. The transitions are parametrized with the fore and aft radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, length $L$ and the optional shape parameter $\\kappa$.\nTwo choices exist when adapting the nose cones as transition shapes. One is to take a nose cone with base radius $R_2$ and crop the tip of the nose at the radius position $R_1$. The length of the nose cone must be selected suitably that the length of the transition is $L$. Another choice is to have the profile of the transition resemble two nose cones with base radius $R_2 - R_1$ and length $L$. These two adaptations are called clipped and non-clipped transitions, respectively. A clipped and non-clipped elliptical transition is depicted in Figure A.2.\nFor some transition shapes the clipped and non-clipped adaptations are the same. For example, the two possible ogive transitions have equal radii of curvature and are therefore the same. Specifically, the conical and ogival transitions are equal whether clipped or not, and the parabolic series are extremely close to each other.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix B\nTransonic wave drag of nose cones\nThe wave drag of different types of nose cones varies largely in the transonic velocity region. Each cone shape has its distinct properties. In this appendix methods for calculating and interpolating the drag of various nose cone shapes at transonic and supersonic speeds are presented. A summary of the methods is presented in Appendix B.5.\nB.1 Blunt cylinder\nA blunt cylinder is the limiting case for every nose cone shape at the limit $f_N \\to 0$. Therefore it is useful to have a formula for the front pressure drag of a circular cylinder in longitudinal flow. As the object is not streamlined, its drag coefficient does not vary according to the Prandtl factor (3.14). Instead, the coefficient is approximately proportional to the stagnation pressure, or the pressure at areas perpendicular to the airflow. The stagnation pressure can be approximated by the function [15, pp. 15-2, 16-3]\n$$\n\\frac{q_{stag}}{q} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 + \\frac{M^2}{4} + \\frac{M^4}{40}, &amp; \\text{for } M &lt; 1 \\newline \\\n1.84 - \\frac{0.76}{M^2} + \\frac{0.166}{M^4} + \\frac{0.035}{M^6}, &amp; \\text{for } M &gt; 1\n\\end{cases} \\quad (B.1)\n$$\nThe pressure drag coefficient of a blunt circular cylinder as a function of the Mach number can then be written as\n$$\n(C_{D_0})_{\\text{pressure}} = (C_{D_0})_{\\text{stag}} = 0.85 \\cdot \\frac{q_{stag}}{q}. \\quad (B.2)\n$$\nB.2 Conical nose cone\nA conical nose cone is simple to construct and closely resembles many slender nose cones. The conical shape is also the limit of several parametrized nose cone shapes, in particular the secant ogive with parameter value 0.0 (infinite circle radius), the power series nose cone with parameter value 1.0 and the parabolic series with parameter value 0.0.\nMuch experimental data is available on the wave drag of conical nose cones. Hoerner presents formulae for the value of $C_{D_e}$ at supersonic speeds, the derivative $dC_{D_e}/dM$ at $M = 1$, and a figure of $C_{D_e}$ at $M = 1$ [15, pp. 16-18...16-20]. Based on these and the low subsonic drag coefficient (3.86), a good interpolation of the transonic region is possible.\nThe equations presented by Hoerner are given as a function of the half-apex angle $\\varepsilon$, that is, the angle between the conical body and the body centerline. The half-apex angle is related to the nose cone fineness ratio by\n$$\n\\tan \\varepsilon = \\frac{d/2}{l} = \\frac{1}{2f_N}. \\quad (B.3)\n$$\nThe pressure drag coefficient at supersonic speeds $(M \\gtrsim 1.3)$ is given by\n$$\n(C_{D_0})_{\\text{pressure}} = 2.1 \\sin^2 \\varepsilon + 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{M^2 - 1}}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2.1}{1 + 4f_N^2} + \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{(1 + 4f_N^2) (M^2 - 1)}}. \\quad (B.4)\n$$\nIt is worth noting that as the Mach number increases, the drag coefficient tends to the constant value $2.1 \\sin^2 \\varepsilon$. At $M = 1$ the slope of the pressure drag coefficient is equal to\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial(C_{D_0})_{\\text{pressure}}}{\\partial M} \\right|_{M=1} =\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{4}{\\gamma + 1} \\cdot (1 - 0.5 \\cdot C_{D_e,M=1}). \\quad (B.5)\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma = 1.4$ is the specific heat ratio of air and the drag coefficient at $M = 1$ is approximately\n$$\nC_{D_e,M=1} = 1.0 \\sin \\varepsilon. \\quad (B.6)\n$$\nThe pressure drag coefficient between Mach 0 and Mach 1 is interpolated using equation (3.86). Between Mach 1 and Mach 1.3 the coefficient is calculated using polynomial interpolation with the boundary conditions from equations (B.4), (B.5) and (B.6).\nB.3 Ellipsoidal, power, parabolic and Haack series nose cones\nA comprehensive data set of the pressure drag coefficient for all nose cone shapes at all fineness ratios at all Mach numbers is not available. However, Stoney has collected a compendium of nose cone drag data including data on the effect of the fineness ratio $f_N$ on the drag coefficient and an extensive study of drag coefficients of different nose cone shapes at fineness ratio 3 [45]. The same report suggests that the effects of fineness ratio and Mach number may be separated.\nThe curves of the pressure drag coefficient as a function of the nose fineness ratio $f_N$ can be closely fitted with a function of the form\n$$\n(C_{D_0})_{\\text{pressure}} = \\frac{a}{(f_N + 1)^b}. \\quad (B.7)\n$$\nThe parameters $a$ and $b$ can be calculated from two data points corresponding to fineness ratios 0 (blunt cylinder, Appendix B.1) and ratio 3. Stoney includes experimental data of the pressure drag coefficient as a function of Mach number at fineness ratio 3 for power series $x^{1/4}, x^{1/2}, x^{3/4}$ shapes, 1/2, 3/4 and full parabolic shapes, ellipsoidal, L-V Haack and Von Kármán nose cones. These curves are written into the software as data curve points. For parametrized nose cone shapes the necessary curve is interpolated if necessary. Typical nose cones of model rockets have fineness ratios in the region of 2–5, so the extrapolation from data of fineness ratio 3 is within reasonable bounds.\nB.4 Ogive nose cones\nOne notable shape missing from the data in Stoney’s report are secant and tangent ogives. These are common shapes for model rocket nose cones. However, no similar experimental data of the pressure drag as a function of Mach number was found for ogive nose cones.\nAt supersonic velocities, the drag of a tangent ogive is approximately the same as the drag of a conical nose cone with the same length and diameter, while secant ogives have a somewhat smaller drag [25, p. 239]. The minimum drag is achieved when the secant ogive radius is approximately twice that of a corresponding tangent ogive, corresponding to the parameter value 0.5. The minimum drag is consistently 18% less than that of a conical nose at Mach numbers in the range of 1.6–2.5 and for fineness ratios of 2.0–3.5. Since no better transonic data is available, it is assumed that ogives follow the conical drag profile through the transonic and supersonic region. The drag of the corresponding conical nose is diminished in a parabolic fashion with the ogive parameter, with a minimum of -18% at a parameter value of 0.5.\nB.5 Summary of nose cone drag calculation\nThe low subsonic pressure drag of nose cones is calculated using equation (3.86):\n$$\n(C_{D_e,M=0})_p = 0.8 \\cdot \\sin^2 \\phi.\n$$\nThe high subsonic region is interpolated using a function of the form presented in equation (3.87):\n$$\n(C_{D_0})_{\\text{pressure}} = a \\cdot M^b + (C_{D_e,M=0})_p\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are selected according to the lower boundary of the transonic pressure drag and its derivative.\nThe transonic and supersonic pressure drag is calculated depending on the nose cone shape as follows:\nConical: At supersonic velocities $(M &gt; 1.3)$ the pressure drag is calculated using equation (B.4). Between Mach 1 and 1.3 the drag is interpolated using a polynomial with boundary conditions given by equations (B.4), (B.5) and (B.6).\nOgival: The pressure drag at transonic and supersonic velocities is equal to the pressure drag of a conical nose cone with the same diameter and length corrected with a shape factor:\n$$\n(C_{D_e})_{\\text{pressure}} = \\left(0.72 \\cdot (\\kappa - 0.5)^2 + 0.82\\right) \\cdot (C_{D_e})_{\\text{cone}}. \\quad (B.8)\n$$\nThe shape factor is one at $\\kappa = 0, 1$ and 0.82 at $\\kappa = 0.5$.\nOther shapes: The pressure drag calculation is based on experimental data curves:\n\nDetermine the pressure drag $C_3$ of a similar nose cone with fineness ratio $f_N = 3$ from experimental data. If data for a particular shape parameter is not available, interpolate the data between parameter values.\nCalculate the pressure drag of a blunt cylinder $C_0$ using equation (B.2).\nInterpolate the pressure drag of the nose cone using equation (B.7). After parameter substitution the equation takes the form\n\n$$\n(C_{D_0})_{\\text{pressure}} = \\frac{C_0}{(f_N + 1)^{\\log_4 \\frac{C_0}{C_3}}} = C_0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{C_3}{C_0}\\right)^{\\log_4(f_N+1)} \\quad (B.9)\n$$\nThe last form is computationally more efficient since the exponent $\\log_4(f_N + 1)$ is constant during a simulation.\n\nAppendix C\nStreamer drag coefficient estimation\nA streamer is a typically rectangular strip of plastic or other material that is used as a recovery device especially in small model rockets. The deceleration is based on the material flapping in the passing air, thus causing air resistance. Streamer optimization has been a subject of much interest in the rocketry community [46], and contests on streamer landing duration are organized regularly. In order to estimate the drag force of a streamer, a series of experiments were performed and an empirical formula for the drag coefficient was developed.\nOne aspect that is not taken into account in the present investigation is the fluctuation between the streamer and rocket. At one extreme a rocket with a very small streamer drops head first to the ground with almost no deceleration at all. At the other extreme there is a very large streamer creating significant drag, and the rocket falls below it tail-first. Between these two extremes is a point where the orientation is labile, and the rocket as a whole twirls around during descent. This kind of interaction between the rocket and streamer cannot be investigated in a wind tunnel and would require an extensive set of flight tests to measure. Therefore it is not taken into account; instead, the rocket is considered effectively a point mass at the end of the streamer, the second extreme mentioned above.\nExperimental methods\nA series of experiments to measure the drag coefficients of streamers was performed using the 40 × 40 × 120 cm wind tunnel of Pollux [36]. The experiments were performed using various materials, widths and lengths of streamers and at different wind speeds. The effect of the streamer size and shape was tested separately from the effect of the streamer material.\nA tube with a rounded 90° angle at one end was installed in the center of the wind tunnel test section. A line was drawn through the tube so that one end of the line was attached to a streamer and the other end to a weight which was placed on a digital scale. When the wind tunnel was active the force produced by the streamer was read from the scale. A metal wire was taped to the edge of the streamer to keep it rigid and the line attached to the midpoint of the wire.\nA few different positions within the test section and free line lengths were tried. All positions seemed to produce approximately equal results, but the variability was significantly lower when the streamer fit totally into the test section and had a only 10 cm length of free line between the tube and streamer. This configuration was used for the rest of the experiments.\nEach streamer was measured at three different velocities, 6 m/s, 9 m/s and 12 m/s. The results indicated that the force produced is approximately proportional to the square of the airspeed, signifying that the definition of a drag coefficient is valid also for streamers.\nThe natural reference area for a streamer is the area of the strip. However, since in the simulation we are interested in the total drag produced by a streamer, it is better to first produce an equation for the drag coefficient normalized to unit area, $ C_D \\cdot A_{\\text{ref}} $. These coefficient values were calculated separately for the different velocities and then averaged to obtain the final normalized drag coefficient of the streamer.\nEffect of streamer shape\n\nFigure C.1: The normalized drag coefficient of a streamer as a function of the width and length of the streamer. The points are the measured values and the mesh is cubically interpolated between the points.\n\nFigure C.2: Estimated and measured normalized drag coefficients of a streamer as a function of the width and length of the streamer. The lines from the points lead to their respective estimate values.\nFigure C.1 presents the normalized drag coefficient as a function of the streamer width and length for a fixed material of 80 g/m² polyethylene plastic. It was noticed that for a speci c streamer length, the normalized drag coefficient was approximately linear with the width,\n$$ C_D \\cdot A_{\\text{ref}} = k \\cdot w, \\quad (C.1)$$\nwhere $ w $ is the width and $ k $ is dependent on the streamer length. The slope $ k $ was found to be approximately linear with the length of the streamer, with a linear regression of\n$$ k = 0.034 \\cdot (l + 1 , \\text{m}).  \\quad (C.2)$$\nSubstituting equation (C.2) into (C.1) yields\n$$ C_D \\cdot A_{\\text{ref}} = 0.034 \\cdot (l + 1 , \\text{m}) \\cdot w  \\quad (C.3)$$\nor using $ A_{\\text{ref}} = wl $\n$$ C_D = 0.034 \\cdot \\frac{l + 1 , \\text{m}}{l}. \\quad (C.4)$$\nThe estimate as a function of the width and length is presented in Figure C.2 along with the measured data points. The lines originating from the points lead to their respective estimate values. The average relative error produced by the estimate was 9.7%.\nEffect of streamer material\nThe effect of the streamer material was studied by creating 4 × 40 cm and 8 × 48 cm streamers from various household materials commonly used in streamers. The tested materials were polyethylene plastic of various thicknesses, cellophane and crêpe paper. The properties of the materials are listed in Table C.1.\nFigure C.3 presents the normalized drag coefficient as a function of the material thickness and surface density. It is evident that the thickness is not a good parameter to characterize the drag of a streamer. On the other hand, the drag coefficient as a function of surface density is nearly linear, even including the crêpe paper. While it is not as definitive, both lines seem to intersect with the x-axis at approximately −25 g/m². Therefore the coefficient of the 80 g/m² polyethylene estimated by equation (C.4) is corrected for a material surface density $ \\rho_m $ with\n$$ C_{Dm} = \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m + 25 , \\text{g/m}^2}{105 , \\text{g/m}^2} \\right) \\cdot C_D.  \\quad (C.5)$$\nCombining these two equations, one obtains the final empirical equation\n$$ C_{Dm} = 0.034 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\rho_m + 25 , \\text{g/m}^2}{105 , \\text{g/m}^2} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{l + 1 , \\text{m}}{l} \\right).  \\quad (C.6)$$\nThis equation is also reasonable since it produces positive and finite normalized drag coefficients for all values of $ w $, $ l $ and $ \\rho_m $. However, this equation does not obey the rule-of-thumb of rocketeers that the optimum width-to-length ratio for a streamer would be 1:10. According to equation (C.3), the maximum drag for a fixed surface area is obtained at the limit $ l \\to 0 $, $ w \\to \\infty $. In practice, the rocket dimensions limit the practical dimensions of a streamer, from which the 1:10 rule-of-thumb may arise.\nEquation validation\nTo test the validity of the equation, several additional streamers were measured for their drag coefficients. These were of various materials and of dimensions that were not used in the fitting of the empirical formulae. These can therefore be used as an independent test set for validating equation (C.6).\n\nFigure C.3: The normalized drag coefficient of a streamer as a function of (a) the material thickness and (b) the material surface density.\nTable C.1: Properties of the streamer materials experimented with.\nMaterialThickness / µmDensity / g/m²\nPolyethylene2119\nPolyethylene2210\nPolyethylene4241\nPolyethylene8680\nCellophane2018\nCrêpe paper110†24\n\n† Dependent on the amount of pressure applied.\nTable C.2: Streamers used in validation and their results.\nMaterialWidth / mLength / mDensity / g/m²Measured 10⁻³($C_D \\cdot A_{\\text{ref}}$)EstimateError\nPolyethylene0.070.21210.991.2627%\nPolyethylene0.070.49411.812.2323%\nPolyethylene0.080.24100.891.1226%\nCellophane0.060.70201.781.4917%\nCrêpe paper0.060.50241.271.4312%\n\nTable C.2 presents the tested streamers and their measured and estimated normalized drag coefficients. The results show relative errors in the range of 12–27%. While rather high, they are considered a good result for estimating such a random and dynamic process as a streamer. Furthermore, due to the proportionality to the square of the velocity, a 25% error in the normalized force coefficient translates to a 10–15% error in the rocket’s descent velocity. This still allows the rocket designer to get a good estimate on how fast a rocket will descend with a particular streamer.\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/ork-hitl/ork/","title":"OpenRocket"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/ork-hitl/rocket-physics-explainer/":{"body":"Understanding Rocket Flight - Simplified\nIntroduction\nHave you ever launched a model rocket and wondered how high it went? Or why some rockets fly straight while others tumble? This guide will explain the physics behind rocket flight in a way that's easy to understand and code into a simulation.\nWe'll build up from the simplest concepts to a complete understanding of how rockets fly, focusing on the practical physics you need rather than complex mathematics.\nPart 1: The Four Forces on a Rocket\nImagine a rocket as a tube being pushed and pulled by invisible hands. There are four main forces acting on it:\n1. Weight (Gravity)\nWhat it is: Earth pulling the rocket down\nHow strong: Weight = mass × 9.81 m/s²\nDirection: Always straight down toward Earth's center\nFun fact: This force never stops, even in space!\n2. Thrust\nWhat it is: The push from hot gases shooting out the nozzle\nHow strong: Depends on the motor (typically 5-100 Newtons for model rockets)\nDirection: Along the rocket's long axis, pushing it forward\nFun fact: Thrust changes over time - strong at first, then gradually decreases\n3. Drag\nWhat it is: Air resistance trying to slow the rocket down\nHow strong: Gets stronger with speed (proportional to velocity squared!)\nDirection: Opposite to the rocket's motion\nThe equation: Drag = ½ × air_density × velocity² × drag_coefficient × area\nThink of drag like sticking your hand out a car window - the faster you go, the harder the air pushes back. But it's not linear - going twice as fast means FOUR times the drag!\n4. Lift (for tilted rockets)\nWhat it is: Sideways force when the rocket isn't pointing exactly where it's going\nWhen it matters: During wind or when the rocket tips\nDirection: Perpendicular to the rocket's motion\nWhy we care: This is what makes rockets weathercock into the wind\nPart 2: How Rockets Stay Stable\nThe Seesaw Analogy\nImagine your rocket as a seesaw (teeter-totter) flying through the air:\n\nCenter of Gravity (CG): The balance point where the rocket would balance on your finger\nCenter of Pressure (CP): The point where all the air forces seem to push\n\nFor a stable rocket, the CP must be BEHIND the CG (toward the tail). Why?\nThink of it like this:\n\nIf wind tips the rocket, air hits the sides\nThe air pushes hardest at the CP\nIf CP is behind CG, this push rotates the rocket back to straight\nIf CP is ahead of CG, the push makes it flip more - unstable!\n\nThis is why rockets have fins at the back - they move the CP backward!\nThe Weather Vane Effect\nA rocket with proper stability acts like a weather vane:\n\nWind from the side creates more pressure on the fins\nThis pressure creates a torque (turning force) around the CG\nThe rocket naturally turns to point into the wind\nThis is called \"weathercocking\" and is actually good - it keeps the rocket stable!\n\nPart 3: Understanding Drag in Detail\nThe Drag Coefficient (Cd)\nThe drag coefficient is like a \"slipperiness rating\" for your rocket:\n\nStreamlined rocket: Cd ≈ 0.3-0.5\nParachute deployed: Cd ≈ 1.5\nFlat plate: Cd ≈ 2.0\n\nBut here's the tricky part: Cd changes with speed! As you approach the speed of sound (Mach 1), drag increases dramatically. This is called the \"transonic region\" and it's why the sound barrier was so hard to break.\nFor our simulation, we'll use a table of Cd values at different speeds and interpolate between them.\nReference Area\nThis is the frontal area of your rocket - imagine looking at it head-on and tracing its outline. For a simple rocket, it's just:\nArea = π × radius²\nPart 4: The Rocket Motor\nThrust Curves\nReal rocket motors don't provide constant thrust. A typical motor:\n\nIgnition spike: Brief high thrust at start\nSustain phase: Steady thrust for most of the burn\nTail-off: Thrust decreases to zero\n\nWe represent this with a thrust curve - thrust values at different times that we interpolate between.\nMass Change\nAs the motor burns, the rocket gets lighter! A typical model rocket motor might:\n\nStart at 20 grams\nEnd at 10 grams\nThis affects acceleration (F = ma, so less mass = more acceleration)\n\nPart 5: Simplified Barrowman Method\nThe Barrowman method calculates where the CP is located. We'll use a super simplified version:\nFor a Basic Rocket:\n\nNose cone CP: About 0.67 × nose_length from the tip\nBody tube CP: At the middle of the tube\nFins CP: About 1/3 up from the fin's trailing edge\n\nThe total CP is the weighted average based on the normal force each part produces.\nFor beginners, we can just place the CP at a fixed location (like 60% back from the nose) and adjust based on fin size.\nPart 6: Flight Phases\nA rocket flight has distinct phases:\n1. Rail Phase (0-5 meters)\n\nRocket slides up the launch rail/rod\nNo rotation allowed\nOnly thrust, drag, and gravity matter\n\n2. Powered Flight (5 meters to motor burnout)\n\nAll forces active\nRocket can rotate\nHighest acceleration\nSpeed increases rapidly\n\n3. Coast Phase (burnout to apogee)\n\nNo thrust\nDrag and gravity slow the rocket\nRocket continues rotating to face into relative wind\n\n4. Apogee (highest point)\n\nVertical velocity = 0\nGood time to deploy parachute\nRocket might be tilted\n\n5. Recovery (apogee to ground)\n\nParachute deployed (if equipped)\nHuge increase in drag\nSlow, controlled descent\n\nPart 7: Coordinate Systems Made Simple\nWe need two coordinate systems:\nWorld Coordinates\nThink of this as the view from the ground:\n\nX = East\nY = North\nZ = Up\nOrigin at launch pad\n\nBody Coordinates\nThink of this as the rocket's perspective:\n\nX = Forward (nose direction)\nY = Right wing\nZ = Down\nOrigin at rocket's CG\n\nWe use rotation matrices (or quaternions) to convert between them. Don't worry - the math looks scary but computers handle it easily!\nPart 8: Putting It All Together\nHere's the simulation loop in plain English:\n\nCommon \"Gotchas\" and Tips\n1. Units Matter!\nAlways use consistent units. We recommend SI (meters, kilograms, seconds, Newtons).\n2. Time Steps\nSmaller time steps = more accurate but slower. 1/120 second is a good balance.\n3. Stability Margin\nCP should be at least 1 body diameter behind CG. This is called the \"stability margin\" or \"static margin.\"\n4. Wind Effects\nWind doesn't push the rocket sideways as much as you'd think - instead, it makes the rocket turn to face the wind, then thrust pushes it that direction.\n5. The Thrust Line\nThrust always acts along the rocket's axis, not necessarily straight up! If the rocket tilts, thrust pushes it sideways too.\nTesting Your Understanding\nCan you answer these questions?\n\n\nWhy do rockets need fins?\n\nAnswer: To move the CP behind the CG for stability\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you make the fins bigger?\n\nAnswer: CP moves further back, rocket becomes MORE stable but turns into wind more\n\n\n\nWhy does a rocket arc into the wind?\n\nAnswer: Wind creates angle of attack, fins create lift force, rocket rotates, thrust now pushes it sideways\n\n\n\nWhat determines maximum altitude?\n\nAnswer: Total impulse (thrust × time), rocket mass, and drag\n\n\n\nWhy use a parachute?\n\nAnswer: Increases drag dramatically for safe landing velocity\n\n\n\nReal-World Example: Estes Alpha III\nLet's look at a real model rocket:\nSpecifications:\n\nLength: 31 cm\nDiameter: 2.5 cm\nMass (no motor): 42 grams\nMotor: C6-5\nFins: 3 triangular, 5 cm root chord\n\nExpected Performance:\n\nMax velocity: ~100 m/s\nMax altitude: ~335 meters\nFlight time: ~30 seconds with parachute\n\nForces at Launch (C6-5 motor):\n\nThrust: ~14 Newtons (peak)\nWeight: ~0.6 Newtons\nNet acceleration: ~20 g's!\n\nAt Max Speed:\n\nDrag: ~2 Newtons\nStill accelerating at ~10 m/s²\n\nAt Apogee:\n\nAll kinetic energy converted to potential energy\nVelocity = 0\nOnly gravity acts on rocket\n\nSummary: The Essential Physics\nIf you remember nothing else, remember these five concepts:\n\nFour Forces: Thrust up, weight down, drag opposite to motion, lift when tilted\nStability: CP behind CG = stable, like a dart or arrow\nDrag: Increases with velocity squared - this limits maximum speed\nMass Changes: Rocket gets lighter as fuel burns, affecting acceleration\nFlight Phases: Powered ascent → coast → apogee → recovery\n\nWith these concepts, you can understand and simulate any model rocket flight!\nNext Steps\nNow that you understand the physics, we can start coding! We'll begin with the simplest possible simulation (1D vertical flight) and gradually add features until we have a full 3D simulation with stability and recovery.\nRemember: Every complex simulation started as a simple one. Master the basics first, then add complexity.

We'll start with the simplest possible case - a rocket flying straight up - and gradually add complexity until we have a full 3D simulation with stability and recovery systems.\nWhat We're Building\nBy the end of this first part, you'll have:\n\nA rocket that launches vertically\nRealistic thrust, drag, and gravity forces\nAltitude and velocity tracking\nVisual feedback of the flight\n\nLet's start with the absolute basics and build up from there.\nSetting Up Our World\nFirst, let's import what we need and set up our simulation environment:\n\nStep 1: Basic Rocket with Gravity\nLet's start with just a rocket falling under gravity - no thrust or drag yet. This ensures our basic physics works.\n\nRun this code and you'll see the rocket fall straight down. Good! Gravity works. Now let's make it go up.\nStep 2: Adding Thrust\nReal rockets don't have constant thrust - they have a thrust curve that changes over time. But let's start simple with constant thrust for 2 seconds:\n\nNow the rocket should shoot up! But it will keep going forever (after thrust ends, it just falls). We need drag.\nStep 3: Adding Drag\nDrag is the air resistance that slows the rocket down. The drag equation is:\nDrag = 0.5 × ρ × v² × Cd × A\nWhere:\n\nρ (rho) = air density (1.225 kg/m³ at sea level)\nv = velocity\nCd = drag coefficient (about 0.75 for a model rocket)\nA = cross-sectional area\n\n\nStep 4: Better Visualization\nLet's add some visual elements to better see what's happening:\n\nStep 5: Ground Detection\nLet's stop the simulation when the rocket hits the ground:\n\nComplete Working Example\nHere's the full code for Part 1:\n\nWhat's Happening?\nWith our parameters:\n\nThrust: 10 N for 2 seconds\nMass: 0.5 kg\nNet upward force: 10 N - (0.5 kg × 9.81 m/s²) = 5.1 N\nInitial acceleration: 5.1 N / 0.5 kg = 10.2 m/s² upward\n\nThe rocket will:\n\nAccelerate upward for 2 seconds (minus drag)\nCoast upward after burnout, slowing due to gravity and drag\nReach apogee (highest point) when velocity = 0\nFall back down\nStop when it hits the ground\n\nExpected altitude: ~20-30 meters (varies with drag)\nExperiments to Try\n\nChange thrust force: Try 5 N (barely flies) or 20 N (much higher)\nChange burn time: Longer burn = higher altitude\nChange mass: Lighter rocket = higher acceleration\nChange drag coefficient: Lower Cd = higher altitude\nRemove drag: Comment out the drag system to see the difference\n\nUnderstanding the Physics\nWhy These Numbers?\nOur simple rocket represents something like an Estes A8-3 motor:\n\nAverage thrust: ~10 N\nBurn time: ~2 seconds\nTotal impulse: ~20 N·s\n\nThis should lift a 500g rocket to about 20-30 meters, which matches real-world experience with small model rockets.\nThe Importance of Drag\nWithout drag, our rocket would reach about 40 meters. With drag, it only reaches about 25 meters. That's a 40% reduction! Drag becomes more important at higher speeds, which is why rockets have pointed nose cones and smooth bodies.\nNext Steps\nIn Part 2, we'll add:\n\nReal thrust curves (not constant thrust)\nAtmospheric model (air density changes with altitude)\nMass change as propellant burns\nBetter data recording and plotting\n\nThe simulation will become much more realistic and start matching real rocket flights!\nSummary\nYou've built your first rocket simulation! It has:\n✅ Realistic gravity\n✅ Thrust force that burns out\n✅ Quadratic drag model\n✅ Ground collision detection\n✅ Visual feedback\nThis is the foundation we'll build on. The physics is real - if you built a rocket with these exact parameters, it would fly almost exactly like our simulation (within ~20% for altitude).\nReady for Part 2?

You can send data as a tuple of the entity id, component id, and value, like so:\n\nThis might not seem impressive at first blush, but it offers some really nice benefits.

It is most used in the context of video games, but as we will find out, it has been used in other places. I'm going to tell a slightly falsified version of the history of ECS to motivate its existence. The first thing to understand is how video games, simulations, and many other software pieces were historically developed using a vaguely object-oriented model. The player would be a class like:\n\nEnemies would be another class in a similar vein. Maybe you would share some attributes between similar types of objects using inheritance, like:\n\nThis way of modeling virtual worlds can feel natural since it matches how we often think about the world. But it has some serious downsides. One key problem is that the world does not have a strict hierarchy. Oftentimes, two things may share a similar behavior but are unrelated in the traditional sense. The other issue is performance. The game object style stores all of an object's data together in a single class, often in the heap. At first, this sounds like an advantage since you can load a single object's data together at the same time. But it has some serious downsides. What if I want to integrate the velocity of all the GameObjects and add it to the position? I will have to write a for loop over all the GameObjects in the world and run the integrate function each time. Each time that function runs, the CPU loads the required fields from RAM and into the CPU cache. But, the CPU doesn't just load the needed fields; it loads all the memory around the GameObject into the cache. This process is called cache prefetching. Ideally, all the GameObjects would be loaded into the cache at once since accessing RAM is slow. But it's time-consuming for the CPU to do that since they are all spread around the heap and are usually large. The next issue is that it is difficult for systems like this to utilize vector instructions effectively. Vector instructions allow you to run the same computation many times in parallel.\nECS has taken the game development world by storm because it solves both problems simply and elegantly. ECS is best visualized as a table\nEntity IDPosVelHealthInventory\n10,0,010,0,01.0\n21,1,20,0,00.0[Apple, Pear]\n\nIn ECS, you have entities, components, and systems. Entities are collections of components and an ID. Components are individual properties associated with an entity, like position, velocity, or health. In an ECS system, the integrated example from above would look like this:\n\nThe code above describes a system, basically a function that operates on a set of components. When this function is run, the computer prefetches all the positions and all the velocities at once. This means that while integrate is running, you never have any cache-missing. It also means that you can effectively utilize vector instructions to speed up the computation. Below is a hypothetical implementation of integrate, where you interact with the entire array at once.\n\nThe clean version of the ECS story is that it has become a more appealing technology as CPU and GPU speed has rapidly outpaced the speed of memory. High-performance applications are usually dominated not by the actual computation time but by memory waits.\nThe true history is that ECS has likely been developed numerous times independently. Some sources (i.e., Wikipedia) cite the 1998 game Thief: The Dark Project as the first time it was used, but they were largely popularized roughly ten years later in a series of blog posts by Adam Martin. Recently, they are starting to gain traction outside of game development.\nAn ECS-based Configurable Physics Engine\nECS isn't just great for video games; it is widely applicable to all kinds of applications. In particular, simulations are a perfect fit for ECS. Simulations benefit from both the organization and performance aspects of ECS; after all, what are video games but complex, not very realistic simulations?\nWe want to build an ECS-based physics engine that utilizes all of ECS's benefits and is easy for non-professional software engineers to use. Historically, writing code that utilizes vectorized operations was a harrowing manual process. Engineers had to write code in an obscure, often difficult-to-read way (https://mcyoung.xyz/2023/11/27/simd-base64/). While the results were very performant, they were not very readable. Simulation code is already difficult to understand due to its heavy reliance on often obscure mathematical methods. Adding complex performance optimizations to that is a recipe for confusion.\nThankfully, there is another math-heavy field that deals with this exact problem – Machine Learning (ML). There are several systems built for machine learning that allow efficient vectorized operations without sacrificing readability. We will focus on two related projects, JAX and XLA. XLA is a compiler that compiles linear algebra operations to GPU, CPU, or TPU. JAX is a JIT for Python that turns standard numpy operations into XLA intermediate representation called StableHLO – technically, it uses MHLO, which is a compatible but distinct IR to StableHLO, which is then converted by XLA into StableHLO. JAX is wonderful because it allows anyone comfortable with Numpy to write efficient code for the GPU. Python is quickly becoming the lingua franca of scientific programming, so this feature is of particular interest.\nOur simulation engine works by merging ECS and Jax into a unified platform. We have ported a subset of Jax's features to Rust, a system we call Nox. Here is an example of how to write a basic six DOF (degrees-of-freedom) physics engine using Nox and our ECS.\n\nLet's walk through what's happening here, and how it works.\nThe first code block is dedicated to setting up all the components required for a six-dof system.\nYou'll see references to SpatialPos, SpatialMotion, and SpatialForce.\nThese are from Featherstone's Spatial Vector Algebra and are a compact way of representing the state of a rigid body with six degrees of freedom.\nYou can read a short intro here or in Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms (Featherstone - 2008).\nNext, you see the Body struct, which is an Archetype, which is a collection of different components that will be found together in an ECS. It allows us to initialize all the components together.\nThen you can see calculate_accel, a function that takes the external forces and torques (SpatialForce contains both) acting on an object and converts them to accelerations.\nThen we spawn a single body into the World, a collection of entities and associated components.\nThen, we build an executable from that world and our systems. You can see that we call a method called rk4 on calculate_accel. RK4 refers to Runga Kutta 4, a widely used integrator for differential equations. RK4 works with differential equations in the form:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt}=f(t,u),\\quad u(t_0)=u_0\n$$\nIn the function call, you can see two generic parameters (2 tuples). The first specifies which components make up $u$ and the second specifies which components make up $\\frac{du}{dt}$\nAs you can see, we have built a fairly simple but complete physics simulation in 34 lines of code. It can run on GPU, CPU, or TPU (Tensor Processing Unit).\nRunning seamlessly on GPUs is not the only nice benefit of our ECS-based Physics engine. You can also see the type-safety that coding like this provides. Math-heavy code can easily fall victim to type errors when everything is stored in untyped matrices. After all, position and velocity are both just vectors of floats and especially when combined with dense shorthand notation, the room for error is immense. Our ECS system uses typing to guide the reader and writer, ensuring that type errors do not occur.\nWe plan to provide several prebuilt simulation pipelines and components, including a version of the popular MuJoCo algorithm and the algorithm used in the Basilisk Astrodynamics framework.\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/ecs/","title":"Why ECS for Physics?"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/introduction/":{"body":"Hardware is Hard\nIf you've ever built anything with hardware involved you know it is incredibly time-consuming. Even the simplest of projects can spiral out of control.\nNever is this more true than for aerospace projects. Satellites have historically taken around 10 years to produce, and even now it can take over a year to produce a simple CubeSat. Drones are usually much quicker to produce, but can still take over a year to make a fully featured drone platform. Rockets, airplanes, and helicopters take this to an even bigger extreme.\nThere are some excellent reasons these projects take so long to produce; they are complex – typically made by large teams of people, often breaking new ground on technology. That's the inherent complexity, the complexity that makes these problems worth solving. There is also the incidental complexity, the complexity that is not required and just comes along for the ride. Elodin's goal is to solve that incidental complexity, starting with a simulation and test platform.\nThe Elodin Way\nElodin's simulation system has 4 primary components:\n\nAn ECS based physics toolkit that allows you to use JAX or Rust to write GPU-backed simulations.\nA cloud Monte Carlo runner, that enables users to run massive numbers of their simulations in parallel.\nA 3D viewer that allows you to visualize your simulation in realtime.\nA communication protocol that links together the simulation, flight control software, and the data-collection system.\n\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/introduction/","title":"What is Elodin"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/jax-nox/":{"body":"When setting about to develop an open and composable physics engine, deciding how to support numerical computation in an efficient and\nexpressive manner was a key exploration. An obvious inspiration we looked to was the Python NumPy ecosystem.\nIf you're not familiar with NumPy, imagine you're working with a massive dataset or a matrix of numbers, and you need to perform calculations\nefficiently. Normally, doing that with regular Python lists would be slow and memory-hungry. Enter NumPy: a tool\nfor high-performance number crunching in Python. NumPy solves this problem by offloading expensive math operations to a fast hyper-optimized C library.\nNumPy gives you ndarrays, which are multi-dimensional arrays that are faster and more memory-efficient than Python's built-in lists. You can\nalso do vectorized operations on these arrays—so instead of writing loops to process each element, NumPy lets you apply operations to entire\narrays at once, like performing element-wise math in parallel. NumPy's core innovation is that it lets you perform vectorized operations on\nmulti-dimensional arrays. A vectorized operation means that the CPU operates on multiple entries in an array simultaneously. NumPy's syntax\nis also less verbose – so instead of writing [2 * x for x in array] you can just write 2 * array and NumPy handles the rest for you.\nIt's also the backbone for other major scientific libraries like SciPy and pandas. NumPy is the most popular way of expressing math in\nPython. It's commonly used in virtually every field, and has developed a large eco-system of libraries.\nAs a result, NumPy has become a staple for numerical computation across schools and industries.\nJAX\nNumPy sounds great! So why not use it for Elodin?\nMillions of simulations running in parallel is a common use case for Elodin. When you are trying to perform a large series of mathematical\nexpressions, finding a way to optimize becomes important. That's where JAX comes in.\nJAX is like NumPy’s supercharged cousin. It gives you all the things you love about NumPy—fast, efficient array operations—but with some\ngame-changing extras that make it ideal for machine learning and other performance-heavy tasks.\nAutomatic Differentiation\nFirst, JAX can automatically compute derivatives of functions, which is super useful for things like training neural networks. You can\ndefine a function, and JAX will figure out how to differentiate it for you, no extra coding required. This is called automatic differentiation,\npopular in machine learning because finding the gradient of a function is crucial for training neural networks.\nJust-in-Time Compilation\nSecond, JAX uses something called just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Normally, when you run Python code, it’s interpreted line by line,\nwhich can be slow. But JAX can take your code and compile it to run way faster, like low-level machine code. So you get the flexibility of\nPython but with near-C++ performance.\nGPU &amp; TPU Acceleration\nThird, it can easily run your computations on GPUs and TPUs by compiling to XLA, without you having to manage\nall that complexity. You just write Python code, and JAX handles sending it to the GPU in the background.\nJAX is like NumPy, but optimized for high-performance computing, like running massive monte-carlo simulations.\nNox\nEnter Nox, a Rust implementation of JAX. Nox is a Rust library that provides a NumPy-like interface for numerical computing, but with the\nperformance and power of JAX. It's a Rust port of JAX, which means you can write your code in Rust and get all the benefits of JAX, like\nautomatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation.\nJAX sounded great! So why re-write JAX in Rust to create Nox? For us, it boils down to 3 reasons.\nPerformance\nOne is that the JAX tracing process can get a little slow for more complex programs. By bringing Jaxprs into Rust, we can optimize the\ncompile path more. This doesn't matter for small simple programs, but for larger programs (especially with lots of unrolling) it could matter a lot.\nProduction-Ready\nThe 2nd reason is that we prefer Rust for making production-ready software. The strong type-system especially allows you to catch many errors\nat compile time, and while Python is moving in that direction, it isn't there yet.\nIntegration\nThe 3rd reason is that we want this software to easily integrate with your existing flight software (the control software for your drone/satellite),\nand using a \"systems\" language like Rust makes that easier. Eventually, we would love to build out a suite of flight software in Rust that can easily\nintegrate with the simulation but is still flight-ready.\nA fun side-effect of this architecture is Nox allows you to write code for both simulations and flight software generically, allowing for seamless\n\"software in the loop\" and \"hardware in the loop\" testing of your flight software.\nAnd The \"Sharp Bits\"\nWhile it's tempting dive in thinking the use of JAX/NOX in Elodin will be just like NumPy, the\nSharp Bits still apply, namely:\nImmutable Arrays\nIn JAX, once you create an array, you can’t change it directly. Think of it like a \"look but don’t touch\" rule. Instead of modifying an\narray in place, JAX forces you to create new arrays with your changes. This can feel weird if you’re used to NumPy, where you can just tweak\nthings in-place. The immutability is important for making sure JAX’s optimizations work smoothly, but it takes a bit of getting used to.\nPure Functions, No Side Effects\nJAX loves pure functions—meaning no messing around with global variables, no printing from inside the function, nothing that changes outside\nthe function's scope. It sounds strict, but it’s necessary for JAX’s magic, like automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation, to\nwork properly. So, if you try to sneak in a print statement while debugging, JAX will throw a fit!\nSubtle Differences from NumPy\nJAX feels a lot like NumPy, but there are some small gotchas. For example, some NumPy functions you’re used to might be missing or work a\nlittle differently. JAX is really built for numbers and arrays—if you try to work with anything else, like random Python objects, JAX won’t be happy.\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/jax-nox/","title":"NumPy, JAX & NOX"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/monte-carlo/":{"body":"With our physics toolkit, you can simulate a wide variety of physical situations. But what's the point of making these simulations?\nOur primary goal is to test control systems for aerospace vehicles.\nIt's not sufficient to test the control systems in just one situation; you need to test them across the entire gamut of possible outcomes.\nTo do that, you can use Monte Carlo testing. Monte Carlo is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the famous Monaco casino.\nThe name originated in the depths of the Manhattan Project during WW2, where they needed a clandestine name to mask the details of the technique.\nAs the name would suggest, Monte Carlo methods work by randomly sampling a system. In this case, the random sampling is of the control system and simulations. You randomize a set of input values to the simulation and then record outputs for each iteration.\nMonte Carlo Challenges\nMonte Carlo systems are commonly used, but they can be particularly challenging for traditional simulation systems.\nMost systems allow you to randomize inputs into the system, but they make it far more challenging to run many simulations in parallel.\nMatLab's license model makes it prohibitively expensive to run parallel simulations.\nOther solutions simply require large amounts of engineering effort and/or massive amounts of computing power to run simulations in parallel.\nOur Solution\nElodin solves these problems by introducing a cloud-based simulation runner that can run up to 100,000 simulations simultaneously. We're able to do so in a cost-effective way by:\n\nUsing the ECS architecture to exploit the inherent parallelism in running the same compute kernel against different sets of data.\nLeveraging XLA to compile the simulation code to run on GPUs.\nUsing the cloud's elasticity to scale up and down as needed.\n\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/monte-carlo/","title":"Monte Carlo"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/coords/":{"body":"The default coordinate systems used in Elodin align with the editor's representation of the (X, Y, Z)\naxes as (red, green, blue) respectively.

It provides all of the spatial information necessary for the elodin.six_dof system\n\n\n__init__(world_pos, world_vel, inertia, force, world_accel) -&gt; elodin.Body\nCreate a body archetype initialized to the provided values.\n\nworld_pos : elodin.WorldPos, default is SpatialTransform()\nworld_vel : elodin.WorldVel, default is SpatialMotion()\ninertia : elodin.Inertia, default is SpatialInertia(1.0)\nforce : elodin.Force, default is SpatialForce()\nworld_accel : elodin.WorldAccel, default is SpatialMotion()\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Inertia is in body frame, all other representations are in the world frame.\n\n    \n\nclass elodin.WorldPos\nWorldPos is an annotated elodin.SpatialTransform component that represents the world frame position of a body in 3D space.

See elodin.SpatialMotion for usage.\n\n\nExample\nA simple example of a 6DoF system that models gravity acting on a rigid body in 3D space.\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        You should never need to use the six_dof time_step parameter unless you need to simulate a sensor at a specific frequency different from the world simulation. This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution, and likely a symptom of needing to move your testing into your flight software &amp; communicate with the simulation over Impel.\n\n    \n\n\n\nComponents\nComponents are containers of data that is associated with an entity. See ECS Data Model for more context on entities and components.\nTo define a new component, add elodin.Component as metadata to a base class using typing.Annotated. The base class can be jax.Array or some other container of array data. This is an example of a component that annotates jax.Array:\n\nclass elodin.Component\nA container of component metadata.\n\n\n__init__(name, type = None, asset = False, metadata = {}) -&gt; elodin.Component\nCreate a new component with:\n\nUnique name (e.g. \"world_pos, \"inertia\").\nComponent type information (via elodin.ComponentType). This is optional if the base class already provides component type information as part of __metadata__, which is the case for elodin.Quaternion, elodin.Edge, and all spatial vector algebra classes.\nFlag indicating whether the component is an asset (e.g. a mesh, texture, etc.).\nOther metadata that is optional (e.g. description, units, labels, etc.).\n\n\nThe above example defines a \"wind\" component that is a 3D vector of float64 values. The \"element_names\" entry is an example of optional metadata. It specifies the labels for each element of the vector that are displayed in the component inspector.\n\n\nComponent.name(component) -&gt; string\nThe unique name of the component.\n\n\nComponent.index(component) -&gt; elodin.ShapeIndexer\nA shape indexer that can be used to access the component data.\n\n\nclass elodin.ComponentType\nComponentType describes the shape and data type of a component. The shape is a tuple of integers that specifies the size of each dimension (e.g. () for scalars, (3,) for 3D vectors). The data type is an elodin.PrimitiveType.\n\n\n__init__(dtype, shape) -&gt; elodin.ComponentType\nCreate a component type from a data type and shape.\n\n\nclass elodin.Edge\nAn edge is a relationship between two entities. See elodin.GraphQuery for information on how to use edges in graph queries.\n\n\n__init__(left, right) -&gt; elodin.Edge\nCreate an edge between two entities given their unique ids.\n\n\n\nArchetypes\nAn archetype is a combination of components with a unique name. To define a new archetype, create a subclass of elodin.Archetype with the desired components as fields. Here is an example of an archetype for a kalman filter:\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        To automatically generate __init__(), you can use the @dataclass decorator.\n\n    \n\n\nThe archetype can then be used to attach components to entities:\n\n\nSystems\nSystems are the building blocks of simulation; they are functions that operate on a set of input components and produce a set of output components. Elodin provides decorators that allow for systems to be easily defined from functions.\n@elodin.system\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        This is a lower-level primitive; for many cases @elodin.map – a wrapper around @elodin.system – is easier to use.\n\n    \n\nThis is a lower-level API for defining a system. A function decorated with @elodin.system accepts special parameter types (such as elodin.Query and elodin.GraphQuery) that specify what data the system needs access to. It returns an elodin.Query containing one or more components. Some examples of @elodin.system are:\n\n@elodin.map\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Graph queries cannot be used with @elodin.map. Use @elodin.system instead.\n\n    \n\nThis is a higher-level API for defining a system that reduces the boilerplate of @elodin.system by unpacking the input and output queries into individual components, and wrapping the body of the function in a query.map(ret_type, ...) call. It is useful for systems with simple data flow patterns. Some examples of @elodin.map are:\n\nThe following systems are equivalent as the @elodin.map definition effectively desugars to the @elodin.system one:\n\nclass elodin.Query\nQuery is the primary mechanism for accessing data in Elodin. It is a view into the world state that is filtered by the components specified in the query. Only entities that have been spawned with all of the query's components will be selected for processing. For example, the query Query[WorldPos, Inertia] would only select entities that have both a WorldPos and an Inertia component (typically via the Body archetype).\n\n\nmap(ret_type, map_fn) -&gt; elodin.Query\nApply a function map_fn to the query's components and return a new query with the specified ret_type return type. map_fn should be a function that takes the query's components as arguments and returns a single value of type ret_type.\n\nIn this example, ret_type is el.Force and map_fn is a lambda function with the signature (el.Force, el.Inertia) -&gt; el.Force.\nTo return multiple components as output, ret_type must be a tuple:\n\n\n\nclass elodin.GraphQuery\nGraphQuery is a special type of query for operating on edges in an entity graph. Edges represent relationships between entities and are fundamental for modeling physics systems such as gravity.\nA GraphQuery requires exactly one type argument, which must be an annotated elodin.Edge component. For example, GraphQuery[GravityEdge] is a valid graph query if GravityEdge is a component with Edge as the base class:\n\n\n\nedge_fold(left_query, right_query, return_type, init_value, fold_fn) -&gt; elodin.Query\nFor each edge, query the left and right entity components using left_query and right_query, respectively. Then, apply the fold_fn function to those input components to compute the return_type output component(s).\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        The return_type component(s) must belong to the left entity of the edge.\n\n    \n\nA single left entity may have edges to multiple right entities, but it can only hold a single value for each return_type component. So, the fold_fn computations for each entity's edges must be accumulated into a single final value. To carry the intermediate results, fold_fn takes an \"accumulator\" value as the first argument. Its output is set as the accumulator value for the next iteration. init_value is the initial value of the accumulator.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        edge_fold makes no guarantees about the order in which edges are processed. For associative operators like +, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative operators like -, the order will affect the final result.\n\n    \n\nSee the Three-Body Orbit Tutorial for a practical example of using edge_fold to compute gravitational forces between entities.\n\n\n\nPrimitives\nclass elodin.PrimitiveType\n\n\nelodin.PrimitiveType.F64 -&gt; elodin.PrimitiveType\nA constant representing the 64-bit floating point data type.\n\n\nelodin.PrimitiveType.U64 -&gt; elodin.PrimitiveType\nA constant representing the 64-bit unsigned integer data type.\n\n\nclass elodin.Quaternion\nUnit quaternions are used to represent spatial orientations and rotations of bodies in 3D space.\n\n\nQuaternion.identity() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nCreate a unit quaternion with no rotation.\n\n\nQuaternion.from_axis_angle() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nCreate a quaternion from an axis and an angle.\n\n\ninverse() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nCompute the inverse of the quaternion.\n\n\nnormalize() -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nNormalize to a unit quaternion.\n\n\nintegrate_body(body_delta) -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nPerform quaternion integration in body-frame with angular velocity body_delta, which must be a 3D vector.\n\n\n__add__(other) -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nAdd two quaternions.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        Adding quaternions does not yield the composite rotation unless they are infinitesimal rotations, use multiplication instead.\n\n    \n\n\n\n__mul__(other) -&gt; elodin.Quaternion\nMultiply two quaternions.\n\n\n__matmul__(vector) -&gt; jax.Array | elodin.SpatialTransform | elodin.SpatialMotion | elodin.SpatialForce\nRotate vector by computing the matrix product. The vector can be a plain jax.Array or one of the following spatial objects: elodin.SpatialTransform, elodin.SpatialMotion, elodin.SpatialForce. The return type is the same as the input type.\n\n\n\nSpatial Vector Algebra\nElodin uses Featherstone’s spatial vector algebra notation for rigid-body dynamics as it is a compact way of representing the state of a rigid body with six degrees of freedom. You can read a short into here or in Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms (Featherstone - 2008).\nclass elodin.SpatialTransform\nA spatial transform is a 7D vector that represents a rigid body transformation in 3D space.\n\n\n__init__(arr, angular, linear) -&gt; elodin.SpatialTransform\nCreate a spatial transform from either arr or angular and linear.

If no arguments are provided, the spatial force is initialized to zero torque and force.\n\narr : jax.Array with shape (6)\ntorque : jax.Array with shape (3), default is [0, 0, 0]\nforce : jax.Array with shape (3), default is [0, 0, 0]\n\n\n\nforce() -&gt; jax.Array\nGet the linear force part of the spatial force as a vector with shape (3,).\n\n\ntorque() -&gt; jax.Array\nGet the torque part of the spatial force as a vector with shape (3,).\n\n\n__add__(other) -&gt; elodin.SpatialForce\nAdd two spatial forces.\n\n\nclass elodin.SpatialInertia\nA spatial inertia is a 7D vector that represents the mass, moment of inertia, and momentum of a rigid body in 3D space.

This data can be used to replay the simulation at a later time. This is useful for debugging, testing, and sharing simulations. Replays also enable running simulations in a headless environment, and then replaying them in a graphical environment.\nTo replay a simulation using the Elodin editor, run the following command:\n\nFile Layout\nAn Elodin replay directory contains:\n\nmetadata.json\nassets.bin\nComponent data Parquet files\n\nmetadata.json\nThis file contains all of the metadata that is needed to replay the simulation. Its schema is as follows:\n\nThere are two top-level keys in the metadata file:\n\n\"time_step\": The time step that the simulation was run with.\n\"archetypes\": A dictionary where the key is the name of the archetype, and the value is a list of component dictionaries.\n\nEach component dictionary has the following keys:\n\n\"name\": The name of the component.\n\"component_type\": A dictionary containing the type information of the component.\n\n\"primitive_ty\": The primitive type of the component, which can be either \"F64\" or \"U64\".\n\"shape\": The shape is a list of integers that specifies the size of each dimension (e.g. [] for scalars, [3] for 3D vectors).\n\n\n\nassets.bin\nThis file is a container of non-component data that's associated with entities. See Well-Known Assets for some examples. Archetypes are often used to link entities to assets by using the asset handle as scalar component data. Some examples of such archetypes are shape, asset_handle_panel, and asset_handle_entity_metadata.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        This file format is currently not suitable for consumption by external tools and is subject to change in the future.\n\n    \n\nComponent data Parquet files\nEach Archetype in the simulation has a Parquet file named after it. The file contains the component data for each entity of that archetype. There is a row for each entity at every tick of the simulation. There are special columns in the Parquet file that are used to store the entity ID and the tick number: \"entity_id\" and \"tick\" respectively. The rest of the columns are the components of the archetype. E.g.:\n\nIn this simplified example, there is a single entity with two components: world_pos and world_vel. The entity has an ID of 0, and the simulation has run for three ticks.\nWell-Known Archetypes\nbody\nbody is a core archetype that's used in most Elodin simulations. It represents the state of a rigid body with six degrees of freedom, and is used by the built-in 6DOF integrators to propagate the simulation forward in time. It also contains most of the necessary information to render the body in a graphical environment. The components of the Body archetype are:\n\nworld_pos: A SpatialTransform representing the body's position and orientation in the world frame.\nworld_vel: A SpatialMotion representing the body's linear and angular velocity in the world frame.\nworld_accel: A SpatialMotion representing the body's linear and angular acceleration in the world frame.\nforce: A SpatialForce representing the net force and torque acting on the body in the world frame.\ninertia: A SpatialInertia representing the body's mass, moment of inertia, and momentum in the body frame.\n\nshape\nshape represents the primitive shape and color of a body. It serves as a link between entity ids and asset ids, as can be seen from its components:\n\nasset_handle_material: A u64 handle to a Material asset.\nasset_handle_mesh: A u64 handle to a Mesh asset.\n\nasset_handle_panel\nasset_handle_panel links an entity to a panel asset. It only has one component: asset_handle_panel, which is a u64 handle to a [Panel] asset.\nasset_handle_entity_metadata\nasset_handle_entity_metadata links an entity to a metadata asset. It only has one component: asset_handle_entity_metadata, which is a u64 handle to a metadata asset.\nWell-Known Assets\nMesh\nMesh assets describe the geometry of a body. Currently, the mesh must be a primitive shape, such as a sphere, box, or cylinder.\nMaterial\nMaterial assets describe the color and texture of a body. Currently, the material must be a solid color.\nGLB\nGLB assets are 3D models in the GLB format. They can be used to represent complex geometries and textures.\nPanel\nPanel assets describe the layout and contents of the Elodin GUI declaratively. They are used to configure viewports and graphs.\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/replays/","title":"Replays"},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/releases/changelog/":{"body":"v0.15\nv0.15.2\n\n(feat) Add native DB snapshot support.

The req_id field has also been removed.\nAdd a --config argument to elodin-db run to provide a custom Lua config file that can pre-configure the database with necessary vtables and metadata.\n\nv0.11.1\n\n(fix) Fix bug where live reload would fail with an \"Address already in use\" error.\n(fix) Fix bug where duplicate panels would be created on live reload.\n\nv0.11.0\n\n(breaking) Add required component_name and entity_id arguments to Exec.history function.\nChange playback speed in the editor using the \"Set Playback Speed\" command in the command palette.\nDisplay plot data as soon as it is available rather than waiting for the simulation playback.\n\nv0.10\nv0.10.1\n\nAdd EGM2008 gravity model to the Python API.\n\nv0.10.0\n\n(breaking) Add \"optimize\" as an optional argument to World.run (defaults to False). This will enable additional optimization passes on the simulation code, which results in faster simulation run times at the cost of slower simulation startup times. This is useful for rapidly iterating on simulation code.\n(breaking) Replace \"output_time_step\" with \"default_playback_speed\" in World.run. This argument sets the default playback speed of the simulation in the editor. A value of 1.0 means that the simulation will run in real-time. A value of 0.5 means that the simulation will run at half speed, and so on.\nExpose more default arguments via type hints.\n\nv0.9\nv0.9.0\n\n(breaking) Remove deprecated time_step argument from World.run. Use sim_time_step instead.\n\nv0.8\nv0.8.0\n\n(breaking) Remove deprecated from_linear, from_angular, and zero static methods from spatial types. Use the constructor instead with optional arguments.\n\nv0.7\nv0.7.4\n\n(fix) Fix bug where editor run would fail if the simulation file was in the current directory because it would attempt to get the parent directory without canonicalizing the path.\n(fix) Fix elodin login in WSL. Previously, it would fail when attempting to open the browser. Now, it will print the URL to the console and you can copy and paste it into your browser.\n\nv0.7.2\n\nUse logical scan codes for the editor's key bindings. This means that keyboard shortcuts will respect your keyboard layout. For example, if you remap your Caps Lock key to Ctrl, the editor will treat Caps Lock as Ctrl as well.\n\nv0.7.1\n\nOn Windows, use Ctrl instead of Super for launching the command palette (Ctrl + P).\n\nv0.7.0\n\n(breaking) Replace --watch option with elodin run.\nAs part of adding process supervision to Elodin, we refactored how watching a simulation works. Now instead of running python3 sim.py run --watch, you run elodin run sim.py.\nAdd locking axis when panning and zooming plots.\nNow you can just move the x or y axis when panning or zooming a plot. Hold down Ctrl to only move along the x axis, and hold down Shift to only move along the y axis.\nAdd ability to run processes alongside simulations.\nYou can now add sidecar processes that are started alongside the main simulation. This is super useful for testing out flight software alongside your simulation.\n\n\nv0.6\nv0.6.2\n\n(fix) Various WASM editor bug fixes.\n\nv0.5\nv0.5.0\n\n(fix) Fix inconsistent axes colors in the editor. Now, +X is red, +Y is green, and +Z is blue across both the navigation widget and the grid lines.\nRespect .gitignore when uploading simulation artifacts for monte carlo runs. Also, ignore hidden files and directories.\n\nv0.4\nv0.4.1\n\nAdd local cache for remote GLB assets to improve model load times and reduce network usage.\nAdd more built-in templates for creating new simulations (ball and drone).\n\nv0.4.0\n\n(fix) Fix cutoff titlebar in editor on browser and windows.\n(fix) Fix bug in the drone example's rate controller where the derivative term wasn't filtered correctly (https://github.com/elodin-sys/elodin/issues/18). It effectively caused the integral gain to amplified and the derivative gain to be suppressed.\n(breaking) Replace el.Time and el.advance_time with el.SimulationTick and el.SimulationTimeStep.\n\nThe simulation tick is automatically advanced by a built-in system.\nThe simulation time step is set to the same value as the \"sim_time_step\" provided in World.run.\n\n\nAdd a built-in SystemGlobals archetype that is automatically spawned for every simulation.\n\nThis archetype is only associated with a single managed entity and contains global variables that can be accessed by any system.\nCurrently, it contains el.SimulationTick and el.SimulationTimeStep which are automatically set to the current tick and simulation time step respectively.\n\n\nAdd icon for the editor on windows.\nAdd support for panning and zooming plots in the editor.\nEnable vsync on Windows and Linux.\nDon't throttle FPS when cursor is not moving on Windows and Linux.\n\nv0.3\nv0.3.30\n\n(fix) Fix issue where edge_fold would not filter out edges where the \"right\" entity doesn't match the \"right\" query.\n\nv0.3.29\n\nSupport adding el.SpatialMotion to el.SpatialTransform.\nAdd body-frame quaternion integration to el.Quaternion via integrate_body.\n\nv0.3.28\n\nVarious bug fixes.\n\nv0.3.27\n\n(fix) Set the correct type information for the return value of el.Quaternion __matmul__. Previously, it would always return a jax.BatchTracer even if a spatial type was being multiplied.\n(fix) Fix issue where CLI is unable to verify the license key.\n\nv0.3.26\n\nImprove simulation startup times.\n\nv0.3.25\n\n(breaking) Use variable positional arguments for el.Panel.vsplit, el.Panel.hsplit, el.Panel.graph, and el.GraphEntity instead of lists. This results in much less verbose panel configuration code. To update your code, either replace the list of arguments with individual arguments separated by commas or unpack the list with *.\n\n(fix): Fix editor crash on Windows due to:\n\nRequested alpha mode PostMultiplied is not in the list of supported alpha modes: [Opaque]\n\n\nGraphEntity constructor now accepts component classes directly instead of el.Component.index(ComponentClass). However, el.Component.index is still needed for slicing and indexing into individual elements of a component.\n\nAdd better default names for viewports and graphs. E.g. Track: \"&lt;entity\nname&gt;\" for viewports and \"&lt;entity name&gt;: &lt;component name&gt;\" for graphs.\nAdd basic support for 3D plots/traces in the editor.\n\nTrace an entity's position by spawning in elodin.Line3d assets:\n\n\n\n\nv0.3.24\n\nDecouple simulation and playback running. You can now pause and rewind the editor without pausing the simulation. You can also change the playback speed by using output_time_step on WorldBuilder.run. We are deprecating the time_step parameter and replacing it with sim_time_step. This is to disambiguate it with run_time_step, which allows you to control the amount of time elodin waits between ticks of the simulation. Setting run_time_step to 0.0 effectively lets you simulate maximum speed.\nAdd max_ticks parameter to WorldBuilder.run. The simulation will run until the specified number of ticks is reached.\nAdd body frame visualization option.\nTo try it out, either open the command palette and type Toggle Body Axes or add the following code to your simulation file:\n\nAdd the ability to create graphs and viewports entirely from the command palette. Try spawning a new graph by typing Create Graph, to see the new workflow.\n(fix) If there were pytest failures in a  Monte Carlo sample, the sample would still be reported as a pass. This is now fixed.\n(fix) Fix line pixelation in long-running plots.\nAdd SpatialTransform() constructor that replaces SpatialTransform.zero(), SpatialTransform.from_linear(linear), and SpatialTransform.from_angular(quaternion) by making use of optional arguments. The old methods are still available but deprecated.\n\nAdd SpatialForce() constructor that replaces SpatialForce.zero(), SpatialForce.from_linear(linear), and SpatialForce.from_torque(torque) by making use of optional arguments. The old methods are still available but deprecated.\n\nDeprecate SpatialTransform.from_axis_angle(axis, angle) in favor of SpatialTransform(angular=Quaternion.from_axis_angle(axis, angle)).\nDeprecate SpatialMotion.from_linear(linear) and SpatialMotion.from_angular(angular) in favor of SpatialMotion(linear=linear, angular=angular).\nAdd filtered search for entities and components.\nAlways include zero as a tick in the y-axis of plots.\nReplace \"Welcome\" panel with a new UI for creating viewports and graphs.\nAdd \"Save Replay\" command to command palette (Cmd + P).\nShow progress bar when executing exec.run(ticks) unless explicitly disabled with exec.run(ticks, show_progress=False).\nAdd a create command for templates to the Elodin CLI\nAllowing naming of viewports and graphs from code.\n\n\nv0.3.23\n\n(breaking) Render the Z-axis as up in the editor (instead of the Y-axis). This is a purely visual change and does not affect simulation results, but it's recommended to update simulations to match the new visual orientation. Typically, this requires swapping the Y and Z axes when operating on spatial positions, velocities, and forces.\n(fix) When a simulation file was changed, the associated pycache files would also be updated, causing the simulation to be re-built multiple times in some cases. This is now fixed.\nAdd Status Bar to the editor (currently shows FPS/TPS and basic version of the connection status).\nelodin editor &lt;path/to/sim&gt; now watches the parent directory of the simulation file for changes in addition to the file itself. This is useful for multi-file projects. This is also the case when using the --watch flag directly. E.g. python &lt;path/to/sim&gt; run --watch.\nExport simulation data to a directory using exec.write_to_dir(path).\n\nv0.3.22\n\n(fix) Fix errors when using vmap with scan, and non-scalar values\n\nWhen the arguments to a scan operation were non-scalar values (i.e their rank was above 0), scan would error in various ways when combined with vmap. The core issue is that some of our logic accidentally assumed an empty shape array, and when that array was non-empty, dimensions would be inserted into the wrong place.\n\n\n\nv0.3.21\n\n(fix) Fix missing 1/2 factor in angular velocity integration and Quaternion::from_axis_angle .\n\nIn nox, the constant Field::two returned a 1 constant. This constant was only used in the implementation of Add between SpatialMotion and SpatialTransform and in Quaternion::from_axis_angle. Unfortunately, this caused angular velocity integration to return incorrect results. This bug caused the applied angular velocity to be multiplied by a factor of 2.\nThe most significant impact of this bug is on the stability of any attitude control system. This bug has led to an increase in small oscillations, potentially affecting the performance of PID controllers tuned to work with previous versions of Elodin. PID controllers tuned to work with earlier versions of Elodin will likely need to be re-tuned\nWe regret not catching this bug earlier. To prevent a bug like this happening ever again, we have taken the following steps:\n\nWe created a set of unit tests for the 6 DOF implementation that compare Elodin's results with Simulink. They have confirmed that our implementation now matched Simulink's 6DOF Quaternion block.\nWe will expand our set of unit tests to have 100% coverage of our math modules. We will test each module against Simulink and other trusted implementations.\nWe will publish documentation on our testing methodology and reports for each module.\n\n\n\n\n(fix) Fix incorrect angular acceleration due to mismatched coordinate frames.\n\nSpatial force and motion are defined in the world frame. The inertia tensor, however, is defined in the body frame. To correctly calculate angular acceleration, torque and inertia tensor must be in the same frame. To fix this, we now transform torque from the world frame to the body frame before calculating angular acceleration. Then, we transform the angular acceleration back to the world frame.\n\n\n(breaking) Split el.Pbr into el.Mesh, el.Material, el.Shape, and el.Glb.\n\nUse the el.shape and el.glb helpers instead\n\n\n\n(breaking) Remove SpatialInertia.from_mass().\n\nUse the SpatialInertia() constructor instead, which now accepts inertia tensor as an optional keyword argument.\n\n\n\nIf a Component base class provides ComponentType information via __metadata__, then it can be omitted from the Component(...) annotation as it can be inferred from the base class instead.\n\nQuaternion, Handle, Edge, and all spatial classes (SpatialTransform, SpatialForce, SpatialMotion, SpatialInertia) have been updated to provide ComponentType information directly. So, components that annotate these classes can now be defined more simply:\n\n\n\nAdd visualization of the current tick in the graph views of the editor.\nAdd TotalEdge, an edge type that connects every entity to every other entity.\nFix issue where stepping backwards or forwards in the editor would sometimes not work.\nAdd Command Palette to the editor\n\nv0.3.20\n\n(breaking) Replace entity builder pattern with a more flexible spawn API.\n\nTo migrate to the new API, replace name() with the keyword argument:\n\nIf the entity has multiple archetypes, just provide a list of archetypes as the first positional argument instead of using insert():\n\nAlso, spawn now returns EntityId directly instead of Entity. So, there's no need to call id() to reference the entity in an edge component or viewport.\n\n\n\nAdd multi-file support for Monte Carlo runs.\nAdd ability to use ranges in viewports for replay.\n\nv0.3.19\n\n(breaking) Allow querying different components from the left and right entities via the new edge_fold API.\n\nTo migrate to the new API, move the graph query's input components to a separate query parameter:\nAnd then reference it in edge_fold:\n\nTo query different components from the left and right entities, use multiple queries:\n\n\n\nMake graph colors deterministic.\nDrop milliseconds from the x-axis in graphs.\nPrevent grid from changing origin.\nAdd ranges to graphs to allow zooming + panning.\nAdd support for spawning graphs and splits from code.\nSwitch to GPU based plotting.\nAdd configurable line width for graphs.\n\nv0.3.18\n\n(breaking) Make RK4 the default integrator (can still override to use semi-implicit euler).\nAdd element names to graphs.\nAdd component priorities.\nComponents in inspector are displayed in descending order of priority.\n\nPriority can be set via metadata. E.g.: metadata={\"element_names\": \"q0,q1,q2,q3,x,y,z\", \"priority\": 5}.\nDefault priority, if unset, is 10.\nComponents with priority of &lt; 0 are hidden from the inspector.\n\n\nIncrease y-axis margin in graphs to prevent axis labels from getting cut off.\nUse scientific notation for large values.\nPrevent graph cursor modal from being cut off.\nAdd interia_diag() helper to el.SpatialInertia.\nFix graph data interpolation issues.\n\nv0.3.17\n\nReduce memory usage of plots.\nAdd rocket example with thrust curve interpolation.\nClear graphs on sim update.\nHave a stable ordering of components in inspector.\nMake decimal point stable in component inspector.\nAdd a built-in Time component + system.\nRemember window size on restart.\nAdd configurable labels for component elements.\n\n","id":"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/releases/changelog/","title":"Changelog"}},"docInfo":{"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/3-body/":{"body":477,"title":3},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/aleph/betaflight/":{"body":152,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/aleph/fc-board-flash/":{"body":136,"title":3},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/aleph/reset/":{"body":270,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/aleph/setup/":{"body":481,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/bouncing-ball/":{"body":791,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/db/architecture/":{"body":381,"title":1},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/db/overview/":{"body":169,"title":1},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/ork-hitl/ork/":{"body":18662,"title":1},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/ork-hitl/rocket-physics-explainer/":{"body":961,"title":3},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/ork-hitl/rocket-sim-1/":{"body":451,"title":4},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/quickstart/":{"body":165,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/data-flow/":{"body":154,"title":3},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/ecs/":{"body":777,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/introduction/":{"body":146,"title":1},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/jax-nox/":{"body":601,"title":3},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/home/tao/monte-carlo/":{"body":176,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/coords/":{"body":379,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/elodin-cli/":{"body":77,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/migration/to-0-15/":{"body":233,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/overview/":{"body":118,"title":1},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/python-api/":{"body":1843,"title":2},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/reference/replays/":{"body":392,"title":1},"https://docs.elodin.systems/preview/pr-274/releases/changelog/":{"body":2420,"title":1}},"length":24},"lang":"English"}
